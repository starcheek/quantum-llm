2510.06212,Anonymous Quantum Tokens with Classical Verification,2025-10-07T17:59:02Z,"The no-cloning theorem can be used as a basis for quantum money constructions which guarantee unconditionally unforgeable currency. Existing schemes, however, either (i) require long-term quantum memory and quantum communication between the user and the bank in order to verify the validity of a bill or (ii) fail to protect user privacy due to the uniqueness of each bill issued by the bank, which can allow its usage to be tracked. We introduce a construction of single-use quantum money that gives users the ability to detect whether the issuing authority is tracking them, employing an auditing procedure for which we prove unconditional security. Bill validation is classical, and hence does not require long-term quantum memory or quantum communication, making the protocol relatively practical to deploy. We discuss potential applications beyond money, including anonymous one-time pads and voting."
2510.06196,Optimised spectral purity of unfiltered photons via pump and   nonlinearity shaping,2025-10-07T17:52:16Z,"Photonic quantum technologies rely on the efficient generation and interference of indistinguishable photons. Exceptional achievements in this respect have been obtained by domain engineering of quasi-phase-matched parametric down-conversion sources, demonstrating high two-photon interference visibility using only moderate bandpass spectral filtering. Here, we optimised the spectral purity and indistinguishability of photons from telecom-wavelength sources by combining Gaussian quasi-phase-matching with Gaussian pump spectral shaping. Without spectral filtering, we used time-of-flight spectrometry to estimate an upper bound spectral purity of 99.9272(6)%, and achieved visibilities of up to 98.5(8)% in two-photon interference experiments with independent sources."
2510.06183,Quantum $f$-divergences and Their Local Behaviour: An Analysis via   Relative Expansion Coefficients,2025-10-07T17:44:37Z,"Any reasonable measure of distinguishability of quantum states must satisfy a data processing inequality, that is, it must not increase under the action of a quantum channel. We can ask about the proportion of information lost or preserved and this leads us to study contraction and expansion coefficients respectively, which can be combined into a single \emph{relative expansion coefficient} for study. We focus on two prominent families: (i) standard quantum $f$ divergences and (ii) their local (second-order) behaviour, which induces a monotone Riemannian semi-norm (that is linked to the $\chi^2$ divergence). Building on prior work, we identify new families of $f$ for which the global ($f$ divergence) and local (Riemannian) relative expansion coefficients coincide for every pair of channels, and we clarify how exceptional such exact coincidences are. Beyond equality, we introduce an \emph{equivalence} framework that transfers qualitative properties such as strict positivity uniformly across different relative expansion coefficients.   Leveraging the link between equality in the data processing inequality (DPI) and channel reversibility, we apply our framework of relative expansion coefficients to approximate recoverability of quantum information. Using our relative expansion results for primitive channels, we prove a reverse quantum Markov convergence theorem, converting positive expansion coefficients into quantitative lower bounds on the convergence rate."
2510.06176,An integrated photonic millimeter-wave receiver with sub-ambient noise,2025-10-07T17:40:21Z,"Decades of progress in radiofrequency (RF) transistors and receiver frontends have profoundly impacted wireless communications, remote sensing, navigation, and instrumentation. Growing demands for data throughput in 6G networks, timing precision in positioning systems, and resolution in atmospheric sensing and automotive radar have pushed receiver frontends into the millimeter-wave (mmW) and sub-mmW/THz regimes. At these frequencies, however, the noise performance of field-effect transistors (FETs) degrades rapidly due to parasitic effects, limited carrier mobility, hot electrons, and shot noise. Parametric transducers that couple electromagnetic signals to optical fields offer quantum-limited sensitivity at room temperature. Electro-optic materials enable receivers that convert RF signals into optical phase shifts. While early demonstrations used resonant devices and recent efforts have focused on cryogenic microwave-to-optical quantum transduction, room-temperature electro-optic receivers have yet to achieve noise figures comparable to their electronic counterparts. Here we demonstrate a room-temperature integrated cavity electro-optic mmW receiver on a lithium tantalate (LiTaO3) photonic integrated circuit with 2.5% on-chip photon-number transduction efficiency, achieving 250 K noise temperature at 59.33 GHz--matching state-of-the-art LNAs. We report the first direct resolution of thermal noise in cavity electro-optic transduction, showing the system is fundamentally limited by thermal photon occupation (~100) in the mmW cavity. Our work establishes integrated photonics as a path to surpass electronic LNAs while offering exceptional resilience to strong electromagnetic inputs and immunity to EMI, establishing cavity electro-optics as a low-noise, chip-scale, EMI-resilient receiver frontend for mmW applications and scalable analog processing in the optical domain."
2510.06172,Anchor: Reducing Temporal and Spatial Output Performance Variability on   Quantum Computers,2025-10-07T17:34:22Z,"Quantum computing, which has the power to accelerate many computing applications, is currently a technology under development. As a result, the existing noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers suffer from different hardware noise effects, which cause errors in the output of quantum programs. These errors cause a high degree of variability in the performance (i.e., output fidelity) of quantum programs, which varies from one computer to another and from one day to another. Consequently, users are unable to get consistent results even when running the same program multiple times. Current solutions, while focusing on reducing the errors faced by quantum programs, do not address the variability challenge. To address this challenge, we propose Anchor, a first-of-its-kind technique that leverages linear programming to reduce the performance variability by 73% on average over the state-of-the-art implementation focused on error reduction."
2510.06171,Quantumness and its hierarchies in PT-symmetric down-conversion models,2025-10-07T17:33:45Z,"We investigate the hierarchy of quantum correlations in a quadratic bosonic parity-time-symmetric system (PTSS) featuring distinct dissipation and amplification channels. The hierarchy includes global nonclassicality, entanglement, asymmetric quantum steering, and Bell nonlocality. We elucidate the interplay between the system physical nonlinearity -- which serves as a source of quantumness -- and the specific dynamics of bosonic PTSSs, which are qualitatively influenced by their damping and amplification characteristics. Using a set of quantifiers -- including local and global nonclassicality depths, negativity, steering parameters, and the Bell parameter -- we demonstrate that the standard PTSS typically exhibits weaker quantumness than its counterparts affected solely by damping or solely by amplification. Both the maximum values attained by these quantifiers and the speed and duration of their generation are generally lower in the standard PTSS. A comparative analysis of three two-mode PTSSs -- standard, passive, and active -- with identical eigenvectors and real parts of eigenfrequencies, but differing in their damping and amplification strengths, reveals the crucial role of quantum fluctuations associated with gain and loss. Among them, the passive PTSS yields the most strongly nonclassical states. Nevertheless, under suitable conditions, the standard PTSS can also generate highly nonclassical states. The supremacy of the passive PTSS is further supported by its fundamental advantages in practical realizations."
2510.06159,Batched high-rate logical operations for quantum LDPC codes,2025-10-07T17:26:10Z,"High-rate quantum LDPC (qLDPC) codes reduce memory overhead by densely packing many logical qubits into a single block of physical qubits. Here we extend this concept to high-rate computation by constructing \emph{batched} fault-tolerant operations that apply the same logical gate across many code blocks in parallel. By leveraging shared physical resources to execute many logical operations in parallel, these operations realize high rates in space-time and significantly reduce computational costs. For \emph{arbitrary} CSS qLDPC codes, we build batched gadgets with \emph{constant space-time overhead} (assuming fast classical computation) for (i) single-shot error correction, state preparation, and code surgeries (ii) code switching, and (iii) addressable Clifford gates. Using these batched gadgets we also construct parallel non-Clifford gates with low space-time cost. We outline principles for designing parallel quantum algorithms optimized for a batched architecture, and show in particular how lattice Hamiltonian dynamical simulations can be compiled efficiently. We also propose a near-term implementation using new self-dual Bivariate-Bicycle codes with high encoding rates ($\sim 1/10$), transversal Clifford gates, and global $T$ gates via parallel magic state cultivation, enabling Hamiltonian simulations with a lower space-time cost than analogous surface-code protocols and low-rate qLDPC protocols. These results open new paths toward scalable quantum computation via co-design of parallel quantum algorithms and high-rate fault-tolerant protocols."
2510.06148,General diffraction properties of aperiodic slit arrays,2025-10-07T17:19:36Z,"Fraunhofer diffraction plays a vital role in experimental physics not only because it accurately describes the behaviour of light in the usual propagation limit, but also because it links the diffracted light with the scattering object through one of the most important mathematical transformations in physics: the Fourier transform. Acting as a probe in material characterisation as well as used as a tool for particle trapping or sensing, the pattern of interference maxima resulting from the Fraunhofer diffraction through periodic scattering is an ubiquitous routine. In this paper we analyse the Fraunhofer diffraction resulting from the much less studied aperiodic scatter of the light. We provide general conditions for the experimental observation of the peaks of interference maxima featured into patterns that display periodic structures on a number of distance scales. Our theoretical analysis is supported by thorough experimental demonstrations."
2510.06147,Non-iid hypothesis testing: from classical to quantum,2025-10-07T17:19:26Z,"We study hypothesis testing (aka state certification) in the non-identically distributed setting. A recent work (Garg et al. 2023) considered the classical case, in which one is given (independent) samples from $T$ unknown probability distributions $p_1, \dots, p_T$ on $[d] = \{1, 2, \dots, d\}$, and one wishes to accept/reject the hypothesis that their average $p_{\mathrm{avg}}$ equals a known hypothesis distribution $q$. Garg et al. showed that if one has just $c = 2$ samples from each $p_i$, and provided $T \gg \frac{\sqrt{d}}{\epsilon^2} + \frac{1}{\epsilon^4}$, one can (whp) distinguish $p_{\mathrm{avg}} = q$ from $d_{\mathrm{TV}}(p_{\mathrm{avg}},q) > \epsilon$. This nearly matches the optimal result for the classical iid setting (namely, $T \gg \frac{\sqrt{d}}{\epsilon^2}$). Besides optimally improving this result (and generalizing to tolerant testing with more stringent distance measures), we study the analogous problem of hypothesis testing for non-identical quantum states. Here we uncover an unexpected phenomenon: for any $d$-dimensional hypothesis state $\sigma$, and given just a single copy ($c = 1$) of each state $\rho_1, \dots, \rho_T$, one can distinguish $\rho_{\mathrm{avg}} = \sigma$ from $D_{\mathrm{tr}}(\rho_{\mathrm{avg}},\sigma) > \epsilon$ provided $T \gg d/\epsilon^2$. (Again, we generalize to tolerant testing with more stringent distance measures.) This matches the optimal result for the iid case, which is surprising because doing this with $c = 1$ is provably impossible in the classical case. We also show that the analogous phenomenon happens for the non-iid extension of identity testing between unknown states. A technical tool we introduce may be of independent interest: an Efron-Stein inequality, and more generally an Efron-Stein decomposition, in the quantum setting."
2510.06115,Self-concordant Schrödinger operators: spectral gaps and optimization   without condition numbers,2025-10-07T16:50:42Z,"Spectral gaps play a fundamental role in many areas of mathematics, computer science, and physics. In quantum mechanics, the spectral gap of Schr\""odinger operators has a long history of study due to its physical relevance, while in quantum computing spectral gaps are an important proxy for efficiency, such as in the quantum adiabatic algorithm. Motivated by convex optimization, we study Schr\""odinger operators associated with self-concordant barriers over convex domains and prove non-asymptotic lower bounds on the spectral gap for this class of operators. Significantly, we find that the spectral gap does not display any condition-number dependence when the usual Laplacian is replaced by the Laplace--Beltrami operator, which uses second-order information of the barrier and hence can take the curvature of the barrier into account. As an algorithmic application, we construct a novel quantum interior point method that applies to arbitrary self-concordant barriers and shows no condition-number dependence. To achieve this we combine techniques from semiclassical analysis, convex optimization, and quantum annealing."
2510.06099,Quantum Strategies to Overcome Classical Multiplexing Limits,2025-10-07T16:30:27Z,"Near-term quantum networks face a bottleneck due to low quantum communication rates. This degrades performance both by lowering operating speeds and increasing qubit storage time in noisy memories, making some quantum internet applications infeasible. One way to circumvent this bottleneck is multiplexing: combining multiple signals into a single signal to improve the overall rate. Standard multiplexing techniques are classical in that they do not make use of coherence between quantum channels nor account for decoherence rates that vary during a protocol's execution. In this paper, we first derive semiclassical limits to multiplexing for many-qubit protocols, and then introduce new techniques: quantum multiplexing and multi-server multiplexing. These can enable beyond-classical multiplexing advantages. We illustrate these techniques through three example applications: 1) entanglement generation between two asymetric quantum network nodes (i.e., repeaters or quantum servers with inequal memories), 2) remote state preparation between many end user devices and a single quantum node, and 3) remote state preparation between one end user device and many internetworked quantum nodes. By utilizing many noisy internetworked quantum devices instead of fewer low-noise devices, our multiplexing strategies enable new paths towards achieving high-speed many-qubit quantum network applications."
2510.06097,On the Quantum Equivalence between $S|LWE\rangle$ and $ISIS$,2025-10-07T16:25:47Z,"Chen, Liu, and Zhandry [CLZ22] introduced the problems $S|LWE\rangle$ and $C|LWE\rangle$ as quantum analogues of the Learning with Errors problem, designed to construct quantum algorithms for the Inhomogeneous Short Integer Solution ($ISIS$) problem. Several later works have used this framework for constructing new quantum algorithms in specific cases. However, the general relation between all these problems is still unknown. In this paper, we investigate the equivalence between $S|LWE\rangle$ and $ISIS$. We present the first fully generic reduction from $ISIS$ to $S|LWE\rangle$, valid even in the presence of errors in the underlying algorithms. We then explore the reverse direction, introducing an inhomogeneous variant of $C|LWE\rangle$, denoted $IC|LWE\rangle$, and show that $IC|LWE\rangle$ reduces to $S|LWE\rangle$. Finally, we prove that, under certain recoverability conditions, an algorithm for $ISIS$ can be transformed into one for $S|LWE\rangle$. We instantiate this reverse reduction by tweaking a known algorithm for $(I)SIS_\infty$ in order to construct quantum algorithm for $S|LWE\rangle$ when the alphabet size q is a small power of 2, recovering some results of Bai et al. [BJK+ 25]. Our results thus clarify the landscape of reductions between $S|LWE\rangle$ and $ISIS$, and we show both their strong connection as well as the remaining barriers for showing full equivalence."
2510.06094,Noise-induced decoherence-free zones for anyons,2025-10-07T16:21:57Z,"We develop a stochastic framework for anyonic systems in which the exchange phase is promoted from a fixed parameter to a fluctuating quantity. Starting from the Stratonovich stochastic Liouville equation, we perform the Stratonovich--It\^o conversion to obtain a Lindblad master equation that ties the dissipator directly to the distorted anyon algebra. This construction produces a statistics--dependent dephasing channel, with rates determined by the eigenstructure of the real symmetric correlation matrix $D_{ab}$. The eigenvectors of $D$ select which collective exchange currents -- equivalently, which irreducible representations of the system -- are protected from stochastic dephasing, providing a natural mechanism for decoherence-free subspaces and noise-induced exceptional points. The key result of our analysis is the universality of the optimal statistical angle: in the minimal two-site model with balanced gain and loss, the protected mode always minimizes its dephasing at $\theta^\star = \pi/2$, independent of the specific form of $D$. This robustness highlights a simple design rule for optimizing coherence in noisy anyonic systems, with direct implications for ultracold atomic realizations and other emerging platforms for fractional statistics."
2510.06086,Identifying chiral topological order in microscopic spin models by   modular commutator,2025-10-07T16:12:33Z,"The chiral central charge $c_-$ is a key topological invariant of the edge characterizing the bulk two-dimensional chiral topological order, but its direct evaluation in microscopic spin models has long been a challenge, especially for non-abelian topological order. Building on the recently developed modular commutator formalism, we numerically obtain $c_-$ directly from single ground-state wave functions of two-dimensional interacting spin models that have chiral topological order. This provides a geometry-independent and bulk diagnostic of chirality. We study two nonintegrable systems -- the Zeeman-Kitaev honeycomb model and the kagome antiferromagnet -- both subjected to scalar spin chirality perturbations. We find that the modular commutator yields results consistent with the expected topological quantum field theories. We also compute the topological entanglement entropy which provides an independent diagnostic of the topological orders. Our work establishes modular commutators as a powerful numerical probe of chiral topological order in strongly correlated quantum magnets."
2510.06076,Universal super-resolution framework for imaging of quantum dots,2025-10-07T16:01:41Z,"We present a universal deep-learning method that reconstructs super-resolved images of quantum emitters from a single camera frame measurement. Trained on physics-based synthetic data spanning diverse point-spread functions, aberrations, and noise, the network generalizes across experimental conditions without system-specific retraining. We validate the approach on low- and high-density In(Ga)As quantum dots and strain-induced dots in 2D monolayer WSe$_2$, resolving overlapping emitters even under low signal-to-noise and inhomogeneous backgrounds. By eliminating calibration and iterative acquisitions, this single-shot strategy enables rapid, robust super-resolution for nanoscale characterization and quantum photonic device fabrication."
2510.06053,Quantum Annealing for Realistic Traffic Flow Optimization: Clustering   and Data-Driven QUBO,2025-10-07T15:46:49Z,"Managing city traffic is a complex NP-hard problem where traditional methods often fail to scale. We present a data-driven approach that reformulates traffic optimization as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization, capturing both congestion reduction and travel-time efficiency. The model integrates simulated realistic mobility data, multiple routing alternatives, and analytically derived penalty constraints. To address large networks, we apply Leiden clustering to preserve critical congestion patterns while reducing problem size. Benchmarking on up to 25,000 vehicles shows that hybrid quantum annealing achieves near-optimal solutions within 1% of the classical solver Gurobi while reducing congestion by up to 25%."
2510.06027,Fermionic versus Spin Baths in non-Interacting Transport Models,2025-10-07T15:24:15Z,"We investigate how fermionic anticommutation shapes transport in a noninteracting resonant-level model where a single central site is coupled to an environment. To this end, we compare a fermionic reservoir with a bath of spin-half modes using exact diagonalization and a perturbative expansion of the master equation to identify the differences. Notably, we find different reduced dynamics for the spin and fermionic baths even though the particles remain noninteracting and both models enforce local Pauli blocking. These differences originate from higher-order terms in the system-bath coupling, where fermionic anticommutation introduces exchange signs in higher-order correlations. By contrast, all second-order contributions, set solely by two-point correlators, coincide. Deviations are largest for small to intermediate bath sizes, fading in the effectively Markovian regime where higher-order corrections are negligible. These results identify when spin baths can be a substitute for fermionic reservoirs and vice versa."
2510.06016,Angular--Momentum--Resolved Aharonov--Bohm Coupling Energy,2025-10-07T15:12:48Z,"The Aharonov--Bohm (AB) effect is conventionally interpreted as a phase shift acquired by charged particles encircling a flux, with no fields acting locally along their paths. Here we show that a confined Dirac electron exhibits a distinct AB \emph{coupling energy} arising from a \emph{local current--potential interaction}, whose form depends on the chosen prescription. In the \emph{wave--particle} (WP) prescription the response is confined to the flux core: only the $l=0$ mode leaves a finite remnant as the core shrinks, while all higher modes vanish. In the \emph{wave--entity} (WE) prescription the $l=0$ result coincides with WP, but for $l\!\ge\!1$ the response becomes a quantized, $l$--linear energy shift. The AB effect thereby emerges as a quantized, mode--resolved energy law that establishes locality through standard field coupling and distinguishes between electron prescriptions."
2510.06010,Hybrid Quantum-Classical Policy Gradient for Adaptive Control of   Cyber-Physical Systems: A Comparative Study of VQC vs. MLP,2025-10-07T15:09:29Z,"The comparative evaluation between classical and quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) paradigms was conducted to investigate their convergence behavior, robustness under observational noise, and computational efficiency in a benchmark control environment. The study employed a multilayer perceptron (MLP) agent as a classical baseline and a parameterized variational quantum circuit (VQC) as a quantum counterpart, both trained on the CartPole-v1 environment over 500 episodes. Empirical results demonstrated that the classical MLP achieved near-optimal policy convergence with a mean return of 498.7 +/- 3.2, maintaining stable equilibrium throughout training. In contrast, the VQC exhibited limited learning capability, with an average return of 14.6 +/- 4.8, primarily constrained by circuit depth and qubit connectivity. Noise robustness analysis further revealed that the MLP policy deteriorated gracefully under Gaussian perturbations, while the VQC displayed higher sensitivity at equivalent noise levels. Despite the lower asymptotic performance, the VQC exhibited significantly lower parameter count and marginally increased training time, highlighting its potential scalability for low-resource quantum processors. The results suggest that while classical neural policies remain dominant in current control benchmarks, quantum-enhanced architectures could offer promising efficiency advantages once hardware noise and expressivity limitations are mitigated."
2510.05905,Fast and Robust Non-Adiabatic Holonomic Gates for Qutrit Systems,2025-10-07T13:17:21Z,"Motivated by shortcuts to adiabaticity, we develop a framework that combines inverse engineering with time-dependent perturbation theory to implement non-adiabatic holonomic quantum computing (NHQC) in qutrit systems under realistic error sources. We derive analytical conditions that suppress second-order Rabi errors through tailored pulse parameters and eliminate detuning errors via a compensation pulse. Our analysis reveals the cancellation from the compensation pulse, which ensures robust gate operations. The proposed approach, broadly applicable to superconducting qubits, trapped ions, and atom-based platforms, provides a pathway to fast and error-resilient holonomic gates, potentially for scalable quantum computing."
2510.05897,Hybrid quantum-classical analog simulation of two-dimensional   Fermi-Hubbard models with neutral atoms,2025-10-07T13:06:41Z,"We experimentally study the two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model using a Rydberg-based quantum processing unit in the analog mode. Our approach avoids encoding directly the original fermions into qubits and instead relies on reformulating the original model onto a system of fermions coupled to spins and then decoupling them in a self-consistent manner. We then introduce the auxiliary spin solver: this hybrid quantum-classical algorithm handles a free-fermion problem, which can be solved efficiently with a few classical resources, and an interacting spin problem, which can be naturally encoded in the analog quantum computer. This algorithm can be used to study both the equilibrium Mott transition as well as non-equilibrium properties of the original Fermi-Hubbard model, highlighting the potential of quantum-classical hybrid approaches to study strongly correlated matter."
2510.05890,Learning stabilizer structure of quantum states,2025-10-07T13:01:43Z,"We consider the task of learning a structured stabilizer decomposition of an arbitrary $n$-qubit quantum state $|\psi\rangle$: for $\varepsilon > 0$, output a state $|\phi\rangle$ with stabilizer-rank $\textsf{poly}(1/\varepsilon)$ such that $|\psi\rangle=|\phi\rangle+|\phi'\rangle$ where $|\phi'\rangle$ has stabilizer fidelity $< \varepsilon$. We firstly show the existence of such decompositions using the recently established inverse theorem for the Gowers-$3$ norm of states [AD,STOC'25].   To learn this structure, we initiate the task of self-correction of a state $|\psi\rangle$ with respect to a class of states $\textsf{C}$: given copies of $|\psi\rangle$ which has fidelity $\geq \tau$ with a state in $\textsf{C}$, output $|\phi\rangle \in \textsf{C}$ with fidelity $|\langle \phi | \psi \rangle|^2 \geq \tau^C$ for a constant $C>1$. Assuming the algorithmic polynomial Frieman-Rusza (APFR) conjecture (whose combinatorial version was recently resolved [GGMT,Annals of Math.'25], we give a polynomial-time algorithm for self-correction of stabilizer states. Given access to the state preparation unitary $U_\psi$ for $|\psi\rangle$ and its controlled version $cU_\psi$, we give a polynomial-time protocol that learns a structured decomposition of $|\psi\rangle$. Without assuming APFR, we give a quasipolynomial-time protocol for the same task.   As our main application, we give learning algorithms for states $|\psi\rangle$ promised to have stabilizer extent $\xi$, given access to $U_\psi$ and $cU_\psi$. We give a protocol that outputs $|\phi\rangle$ which is constant-close to $|\psi\rangle$ in time $\textsf{poly}(n,\xi^{\log \xi})$, which can be improved to polynomial-time assuming APFR. This gives an unconditional learning algorithm for stabilizer-rank $k$ states in time $\textsf{poly}(n,k^{k^2})$. As far as we know, learning arbitrary states with even stabilizer-rank $k \geq 2$ was unknown."
2510.05887,Full Eigenstate Thermalization in Integrable Spin Systems,2025-10-07T12:59:13Z,"The Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis(ETH) is a standard tool to understand the thermalization properties of an isolated quantum system. Its generalization to higher order correlations of matrix elements of local operators, dubbed the full ETH, predicts the decomposition of higher-order correlation function into thermal free cumulants. In this work, we numerically test these predictions of full ETH using exact diagonalization of two spin models: the Ising and the XXZ Heisenberg models. The differences from the behavior of full ETH prediction in chaotic systems are highlighted and contrasted along the way. We also show that although in these integrable spin models the dynamics of the four-time correlators, specifically the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC), is encoded in the fourth order free cumulant, it exhibits late-time dynamics that is different from nonintegrable systems."
2510.05872,Entanglement dynamics and performance of two-qubit gates for   superconducting qubits under non-Markovian effects,2025-10-07T12:40:54Z,"Within a numerically exact simulation technique, the dissipative dynamics of a two-qubit architecture is considered in which each qubit couples to its individual noise source (reservoir). The goal is to reveal the role of subtle qubit-reservoir correlations including non-Markovian processes as a prerequisite to guide further improvements of quantum computing devices. This paper addresses the following three topics. First, we examine the validity of the rotating wave approximation imposed previously on the qubit-reservoir coupling with respect to the disentanglement dynamics. Second, generation of the entanglement as well as destruction are analyzed by monitoring the reduced dynamics during and after application of a $\sqrt{\mbox{iSWAP}^\dagger}$ gate, also focusing on memory effects caused by reservoirs. Finally, the performance of a Hadamard + CNOT sequence is analyzed for different gate decomposition schemes. In all three cases, various types of noise sources and qubit parameters are considered."
2510.05854,Dynamic Scheduling in Fiber and Spaceborne Quantum Repeater Networks,2025-10-07T12:23:46Z,"The problem of scheduling in quantum networks amounts to choosing which entanglement swapping operations to perform to better serve user demand. The choice can be carried out following a variety of criteria (e.g. ensuring all users are served equally vs. prioritizing specific critical applications, adopting heuristic or optimization-based algorithms...), requiring a method to compare different solutions and choose the most appropriate. We present a framework to mathematically formulate the scheduling problem over quantum networks and benchmark general quantum scheduling policies over arbitrary lossy quantum networks. By leveraging the framework, we apply Lyapunov drift minimization to derive a novel class of quadratic optimization based scheduling policies, which we then analyze and compare with a Max Weight inspired linear class. We then give an overview of the pre-existing fiber quantum simulation tools and report on the development of numerous extensions to QuISP, an established quantum network simulator focused on scalability and accuracy in modeling the underlying classical network infrastructure. To integrate satellite links in the discussion, we derive an analytical model for the entanglement distribution rates for satellite-to-ground and ground-satellite-ground links and discuss different quantum memory allocation policies for the dual link case. Our findings show that classical communication latency is a major limiting factor for satellite communication, and the effects of physical upper bounds such as the speed of light must be taken into account when designing quantum links, limiting the attainable rates to tens of kHz. We conclude by summarizing our findings and highlighting the challenges that still need to be overcome in order to study the quantum scheduling problem over fiber and satellite quantum networks.

2510.05853,Hayden--Preskill Model via Local Quenches,2025-10-07T12:23:12Z,"We model the Hayden--Preskill (HP) information recovery protocol in 2d CFTs via local joining quenches. Euclidean path integrals with slits prepare the HP subsystems: the message $M$, its reference $N$, the Page-time black hole $B$, the early radiation $E$, and the late radiation $R$; the remaining black hole after emitting $R$ is denoted as $B'$. The single-slit geometry provides an analytically tractable toy model, while the bounded-slit geometry more closely captures the HP setup. In the free Dirac fermion 2d CFT, the mutual information $I(N\!:\!B')$ shows quasi-particle dynamics with partial or full revivals, whereas that in holographic 2d CFTs, which are expected to be maximally chaotic, exhibit sharp transitions: in the bounded-slit case, when the size of the late radiation becomes comparable to that of the reference $N$, $I(N\!:\!B')$ does vanish at late time, otherwise it remains finite. This contrast between free CFTs and holographic CFTs gives a clear characterization of the HP recovery threshold."
2510.05851,Hybrid Sequential Quantum Computing,2025-10-07T12:15:43Z,"We introduce hybrid sequential quantum computing (HSQC), a paradigm for combinatorial optimization that systematically integrates classical and quantum methods within a structured, stage-wise workflow. HSQC may involve an arbitrary sequence of classical and quantum processes, as long as the global result outperforms the standalone components. Our testbed begins with classical optimizers to explore the solution landscape, followed by quantum optimization to refine candidate solutions, and concludes with classical solvers to recover nearby or exact-optimal states. We demonstrate two instantiations: (i) a pipeline combining simulated annealing (SA), bias-field digitized counterdiabatic quantum optimization (BF-DCQO), and memetic tabu search (MTS); and (ii) a variant combining SA, BF-DCQO, and a second round of SA. This workflow design is motivated by the complementary strengths of each component. Classical heuristics efficiently find low-energy configurations, but often get trapped in local minima. BF-DCQO exploits quantum resources to tunnel through these barriers and improve solution quality. Due to decoherence and approximations, BF-DCQO may not always yield optimal results. Thus, the best quantum-enhanced state is used to continue with a final classical refinement stage. Applied to challenging higher-order unconstrained binary optimization (HUBO) problems on a 156-qubit heavy-hexagonal superconducting quantum processor, we show that HSQC consistently recovers ground-state solutions in just a few seconds. Compared to standalone classical solvers, HSQC achieves a speedup of up to 700 times over SA and up to 9 times over MTS in estimated runtimes. These results demonstrate that HSQC provides a flexible and scalable framework capable of delivering up to two orders of magnitude improvement at runtime quantum-advantage level on advanced commercial quantum processors."
2510.05816,Optimal ancilla-free Clifford+T synthesis for general single-qubit   unitaries,2025-10-07T11:37:02Z,"We propose two Clifford+$T$ synthesis algorithms that are optimal with respect to $T$-count. The first algorithm, called deterministic synthesis, approximates any single-qubit unitary by a single-qubit Clifford+$T$ circuit with the minimum $T$-count. The second algorithm, called probabilistic synthesis, approximates any single-qubit unitary by a probabilistic mixture of single-qubit Clifford+$T$ circuits with the minimum $T$-count. For most of single-qubit unitaries, the runtimes of deterministic synthesis and probabilistic synthesis are $\varepsilon^{-1/2 - o(1)}$ and $\varepsilon^{-1/4 - o(1)}$, respectively, for an approximation error $\varepsilon$. Although this complexity is exponential in the input size, we demonstrate that our algorithms run in practical time at $\varepsilon \approx 10^{-15}$ and $\varepsilon \approx 10^{-22}$, respectively. Furthermore, we show that, for most single-qubit unitaries, the deterministic synthesis algorithm requires at most $3\log_2(1/\varepsilon) + o(\log_2(1/\varepsilon))$ $T$-gates, and the probabilistic synthesis algorithm requires at most $1.5\log_2(1/\varepsilon) + o(\log_2(1/\varepsilon))$ $T$-gates. Remarkably, complexity analyses in this work do not rely on any numerical or number-theoretic conjectures."
2510.05795,Efficient Post-Selection for General Quantum LDPC Codes,2025-10-07T11:11:50Z,"Post-selection strategies that discard low-confidence computational results can significantly improve the effective fidelity of quantum error correction at the cost of reduced acceptance rates, which can be particularly useful for offline resource state generation. Prior work has primarily relied on the ""logical gap"" metric with the minimum-weight perfect matching decoder, but this approach faces fundamental limitations including computational overhead that scales exponentially with the number of logical qubits and poor generalizability to arbitrary codes beyond surface codes. We develop post-selection strategies based on computationally efficient heuristic confidence metrics that leverage error cluster statistics (specifically, aggregated cluster sizes and log-likelihood ratios) from clustering-based decoders, which are applicable to arbitrary quantum low-density parity check (QLDPC) codes. We validate our method through extensive numerical simulations on surface codes, bivariate bicycle codes, and hypergraph product codes, demonstrating orders of magnitude reductions in logical error rates with moderate abort rates. For instance, applying our strategy to the $[[144, 12, 12]]$ bivariate bicycle code achieves approximately three orders of magnitude reduction in the logical error rate with an abort rate of only 1% (19%) at a physical error rate of 0.1% (0.3%). Additionally, we integrate our approach with the sliding-window framework for real-time decoding, featuring early mid-circuit abort decisions that eliminate unnecessary overheads. Notably, its performance matches or even surpasses the original strategy for global decoding, while exhibiting favorable scaling in the number of rounds. Our approach provides a practical foundation for efficient post-selection in fault-tolerant quantum computing with QLDPC codes."
2510.05794,Implementation of multiparticle quantum speed limits on observables,2025-10-07T11:11:24Z,"The energy-time uncertainty relation limits the maximum speed of quantum system evolution and is crucial for determining whether quantum tasks can be accelerated. However, multiparticle quantum speed limits have not been experimentally explored. In this work, we experimentally verify that both multiparticles and entanglement can accelerate the quantum speed on observables in two-particle systems based on ultrahigh precision control of quantum evolution time. Furthermore, we experimentally prove that the initial quantum state plays a critical role in the quantum speed limits of the entangled systems. In addition, we experimentally demonstrate that the upper bound and lower bound of the quantum speed are workable even in a nonunitary Markovian open system with two photons. The results obtained based on two-photon experiments have been shown to be generalizable to more particles. Our work facilitates the characterization of the dynamic transient properties of complex quantum systems and the control of the quantum speed of large-scale quantum systems."
2510.05792,First experimental measurements of biophotons from Astrocytes and   Glioblastoma cell cultures,2025-10-07T11:10:42Z,"Biophotons are non-thermal and non-bioluminescent ultraweak photon emissions, first hypothesised by Gurwitsch in 1924 as a regulatory mechanism in cell division, and then experimentally observed in living organisms. Today, two main hypotheses explain their origin: stochastic decay of excited molecules and coherent electromagnetic fields produced in biochemical processes. Recent interest focuses on the role of biophotons in cellular communication and disease monitoring. This study presents the first campaign of biophoton emission measurements from cultured astrocytes and glioblastoma cells, conducted at Fondazione Pisana per la Scienza (FPS) using two ultra-sensitive setups developed by the collaboration at the National Laboratories of Frascati (LNF-INFN) and at the University of Rome II - Tor Vergata. The statistical analyses of the data collected revealed a clear separation between cellular signals and dark noise, confirming the high sensitivity of the apparatuses. The Diffusion Entropy Analysis (DEA) was applied to the data to uncover dynamic patterns, revealing anomalous diffusion and long-range memory effects potentially related to intercellular signalling and cellular communication. These findings support the hypothesis that biophoton emissions encode rich information beyond intensity, reflecting metabolic and pathological states. The differences that emerged from the application of Diffusion Entropy Analysis to the biophotonic signals of Astrocytes and Glioblastoma are highlighted and discussed in the paper. This work lays the foundation for future studies on neuronal cultures and proposes biophoton dynamics as a promising tool for non-invasive diagnostics and cellular communication research."
2510.05776,The PESCAD Method for Autonomous Systems: An Application to   Photoionization at Near-optical Wavelengths,2025-10-07T10:45:26Z,"In a recent publication, Dalen, and Selst{\o}, Phys. Rev. A {\bf 111}, 033116 (2025), it was demonstrated how converged photo electron spectra could be determined using a complex absorbing potential on a truncated numerical domain considerably smaller than the extension of the dynamical wave function. That approach required simulation until virtually all unbound parts of the wave function was absorbed, far beyond the duration of the interaction with the external field. In this work we formulate the method in a semi-analytical manner which allows us to extrapolate to infinite times after the interaction with the external field. In addition to obtaining photoelectron spectra for hydrogen differential in energy and ejection angle, we also demonstrate how -- and when -- the absorber may be seen as a detector, distorting the angular distributions when the detector is placed in the extreme vicinity of the atom."
2510.05734,All-optical bubble trap for ultracold atoms in microgravity,2025-10-07T09:55:22Z,"In this paper, we present an all-optical method to produce shell-shaped traps for ultracold atoms in microgravity. Our scheme exploits optical double dressing of the ground state to create a short range strongly repulsive central potential barrier. Combined with a long range attractive central potential, this barrier forms the shell trap. We demonstrate that a pure spherical bubble, reaching the quasi 2D regime for standard atom numbers, could be formed from two crossed beams with a parabolic profile. An analytical study shows that the relevant characteristics of the trap depend on the ratio of the ground and excited state polarisabilities and the lifetime of the excited state. As a benchmark, we provide quantitative analysis of a realistic configuration for rubidium ensembles, leading to a 250 Hz transverse confinement for a 35 $\mu$m radius bubble and a trap residual scattering rate of less than 10 s$^{-1}$."
2510.05708,Low Overhead Universal Quantum Computation with Triorthogonal Codes,2025-10-07T09:17:10Z,"We explore the use of triorthogonal codes for universal fault-tolerant quantum computation and propose two methods to circumvent the Eastin-Knill theorem, which prohibits any single quantum error-correcting code from supporting both universality and a transversal gate set. First, we simplify the implementation of the logical Hadamard gate for triorthogonal codes by exploiting the fact that they have transversal controlled-Z (CZ) gates, resulting in a circuit with reduced overhead. Then, we introduce procedure for generating a symmetric Calderbank-Shor-Steane code paired with a triorthogonal code, which allows CNOT and CZ gate transversality across the pair of codes. We also present a circuit for realizing a logical state teleportation protocol between the two codes, enabling all logical operations to be performed transversally. Finally, we demonstrate how these methods can be integrated into the Steane error correction framework without incurring additional resource cost."
2510.05653,Valley-dependent topological interface states in biased armchair   nanoribbons in gapless graphene,2025-10-07T08:04:39Z,"We investigate an electrical bias-controlled, topological kind discontinuity in valley polarization, in a two-segment armchair nanoribbon of gapless graphene, where the discontinuity is created at the interface by applying opposite in-plane, transverse electrical biases to the two segments. In particular, using an efficient tight-binding theoretical formulation, we explicitly obtain energy eigenvalues and probability distributions of discontinuity-induced, interface-confined electron eigenstates, in a reference configuration. Moreover, implications of the confinement for electron transport are explored. A configurational variation is introduced to transform the eigenstates into transport-active, quasi-localized ones. Such states are shown to result in Fano ""anti-resonances"" in transmission spectra. The resilience of the quasi-localized states and their associated Fano fingerprints is also illustrated with respect to configurational fluctuations, demonstrating their potential detectability in realistic devices and suggesting transport spectroscopy as a practical probe of valley-dependent topological interface physics in graphene nanoribbons."
2510.05647,Tensor Network Loop Cluster Expansions for Quantum Many-Body Problems,2025-10-07T07:48:10Z,"We analyze the tensor network loop cluster expansion, introduced in arXiv:2504.07344 as a systematic correction to belief propagation, in the context of general quantum many-body problems. We provide numerical examples of the accuracy and practical applicability of the approach for the computation of ground-state observables for high bond dimension tensor networks, in two- and three-dimensions, with open and periodic boundary conditions, and for spin and fermion problems."
2510.05642,Recovery of the second law in fully quantum thermodynamics,2025-10-07T07:42:38Z,"Quantum thermodynamics investigates how robust the second law of thermodynamics serves as the unique fundamental law in the small quantum world. To tackle this problem, the quantum coherence constitutes a major difficulty of investigations, which provides severe constraints hindering the recovery of a single thermodynamic potential. Here we solve this long-standing problem of quantum information theory by revealing that the state convertibility under thermal operations is fully characterized by the second law of thermodynamics. Specifically, we prove that whether a quantum state with quantum coherence is convertible to another by a thermal operation with a correlated catalyst is completely determined by the free energy ordering. Unlike previous attempts, our setting does not resort to any additional external coherent assist, providing a faithful operational characterization of thermodynamic state transformation."
2510.05622,An approach using geometric diagrams to generic Bell inequalities with   multiple observables,2025-10-07T07:11:49Z,"We extend the generic Bell inequalities suggested by Son, Lee, and Kim [Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 060406 (2006)] to incorporate multiple observables for tripartite systems and introduce a geometric methodology for calculating classical upper bounds of the inequalities. Our method transforms the problem of finding the classical upper bounds into identifying constraints in linear congruence relations. Using this approach, we derive the upper bounds for scenarios with three and four observables per party. In order to demonstrate quantum violations, we employ Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger entangled states that can achieve values exceeding the classical upper bounds, with the violation becoming more pronounced as the number of observables increases."
2510.05607,Quantum interference between autonomous dissimilar quantum light sources   for hybrid quantum networks,2025-10-07T06:03:22Z,"Hybrid quantum systems play a crucial role in advancing scalable and versatile quantum networks as they combine the strengths of different quantum platforms. An important challenge for the development of hybrid quantum networks lies in interfacing heterogeneous quantum nodes and distributing entanglement among them. Single photons emitted from these dissimilar quantum nodes typically show distinct spectral and temporal properties. Therefore, they necessitate spectral filtering and temporal synchronization, which introduce significant photon losses and require additional resources. In this work, we successfully generate indistinguishable photons from two distinct quantum systems of a warm atomic ensemble and a solid-state quantum dot. Remarkably, quantum interference between dissimilar sources is achieved without additional spectral filtering and time synchronization, which enables autonomous quantum nodes for a hybrid quantum network. 133Cs atomic ensemble can efficiently generate heralded single photons at the wavelength of 917 nm of the 6P_(3/2)-6D_(5/2) transition, while the single photons emitted from an InAs/GaAs quantum dot can be tuned to match the 133Cs transition wavelength. Our dense warm atomic ensemble and cavity-coupled quantum dot can efficiently generate bright and resonant single photons at detection rates approaching MHz, respectively. More importantly, these single photons exhibit inherent spectral similarities not only in the wavelength but also in the spectral linewidth, achieving a high spectral overlap of 0.92. Such intrinsic compatibility between dissimilar quantum sources is essential to leverage the advantages of different quantum platforms, paving the way toward a large-scale and functional hybrid quantum network."
2510.05600,A fluorescence microscopy platform for time-resolved studies of   spin-correlated radical pairs in biological systems,2025-10-07T05:51:58Z,"The importance of spin-correlated radical pairs in biology is increasingly recognized, with roles in biological effects of weak magnetic fields and emerging quantum spin-based biomedical applications. Fluorescence microscopy offers sufficient sensitivity to study magnetic field effects on radical pair reactions in living cells, but conventional techniques cannot directly resolve their dynamics because most biologically relevant radical pairs are non-emissive. To overcome this challenge, we introduce two novel microscopy techniques: single color pump-probe (PP) and pump-field-probe (PFP) fluorescence. Here, we describe their working principles, provide their mathematical formulation, and validate both techniques through theoretical analysis and experiments on well-established flavin-based magnetic field sensitive reactions. These approaches offer a sensitive and broadly applicable platform for quantifying and visualizing the quantum spin dynamics of radical pair chemical reactions in biological systems."
2510.05594,Quantum Kernel Anomaly Detection Using AR-Derived Features from   Non-Contact Acoustic Monitoring for Smart Manufacturing,2025-10-07T05:42:44Z,"The evolution of manufacturing toward smart factories has underscored major challenges in equipment maintenance, particularly the dependence on numerous contact sensors for anomaly detection, leading to increased sensor complexity and computational costs. This study explores the use of quantum kernels to enhance anomaly detection based on noncontact sensors. We hypothesize that the expressive power of quantum feature spaces can effectively discriminate among multiple anomaly types using fewer sensors. Experiments were conducted on two types of manufacturing equipment a conveyor and a chain belt machine where a single directional microphone was placed at varying distances (0 to 3 m) to capture audio data. The signals were processed using autoregressive (AR) modeling to extract coefficient based features, which were then mapped into quantum feature space via quantum kernels for one class SVM classification. The quantum kernel classifiers achieved consistently high accuracy and F1 scores (more than 0.92) across all distances, while classical counterparts exhibited significant degradation beyond 0 m. Visualization of the feature space revealed clear separability, with distinct quadrants corresponding to different anomaly types: conveyor anomalies were mainly distributed in the second quadrant, and chain belt anomalies clustered in the fourth. These results demonstrate that quantum kernel methods can achieve robust, multi class anomaly detection in noisy factory environments using minimal non contact sensors. This represents a significant advancement toward quantum enhanced smart factories with reduced sensing infrastructure and improved maintenance efficiency. This work has been accepted for presentation at IEEE QCE25 and will appear in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library."
2510.05588,A New Quantum Linear System Algorithm Beyond the Condition Number and   Its Application to Solving Multivariate Polynomial Systems,2025-10-07T05:28:25Z,"Given a matrix $A$ of dimension $M \times N$ and a vector $\vec{b}$, the quantum linear system (QLS) problem asks for the preparation of a quantum state $|\vec{y}\rangle$ proportional to the solution of $A\vec{y} = \vec{b}$. Existing QLS algorithms have runtimes that scale linearly with the condition number $\kappa(A)$, the sparsity of $A$, and logarithmically with inverse precision, but often overlook structural properties of $\vec{b}$, whose alignment with $A$'s eigenspaces can greatly affect performance.   In this work, we present a new QLS algorithm that explicitly leverages the structure of the right-hand side vector $\vec{b}$. The runtime of our algorithm depends polynomially on the sparsity of the augmented matrix $H = [A, -\vec{b}]$, the inverse precision, the $\ell_2$ norm of the solution $\vec{y} = A^+ \vec{b}$, and a new instance-dependent parameter \[ ET= \sum_{i=1}^M p_i^2 \cdot d_i, \] where $\vec{p} = (AA^{\top})^+ \vec{b}$, and $d_i$ denotes the squared $\ell_2$ norm of the $i$-th row of $H$. We also introduce a structure-aware rescaling technique tailored to the solution $\vec{y} = A^+ \vec{b}$. Unlike left preconditioning methods, which transform the linear system to $DA\vec{y} = D\vec{b}$, our approach applies a right rescaling matrix, reformulating the linear system as $AD\vec{z} = \vec{b}$.   As an application of our instance-aware QLS algorithm and new rescaling scheme, we develop a quantum algorithm for solving multivariate polynomial systems in regimes where prior QLS-based methods fail. This yields an end-to-end framework applicable to a broad class of problems. In particular, we apply it to the maximum independent set (MIS) problem, formulated as a special case of a polynomial system, and show through detailed analysis that, under certain conditions, our quantum algorithm for MIS runs in polynomial time."
2510.05576,Quantum approximate optimization of bosonic finite-state systems,2025-10-07T04:44:13Z,"There exist numerous problems in nature inherently described by finite $D$-dimensional states. Formulating these problems for execution on qubit-based quantum hardware requires mapping the qudit Hilbert space to that of multiqubit which may be exponentially larger. To exclude the infeasible subspace, one common approach relies on penalizing the objective function. However, this strategy can be inefficient as the size of the illegitimate subspace grows. Here we propose to employ the Hamiltonian-based quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) through devising appropriate mixing Hamiltonians such that the infeasible configuration space is ruled out. We investigate this idea by employing binary, symmetric, and unary mapping techniques. It is shown that the standard mixing Hamiltonian (sum of the bit-flip operations) is the optimal option for symmetric mapping, where the controlled-NOT gate count is used as a measure of implementation cost. In contrast, the other two encoding schemes witness a $p$-fold increase in this figure for a $p$-layer QAOA. We apply this framework to quantum approximate thermalization and find the ground state of the repulsive Bose-Hubbard model in the strong and weak interaction regimes."
2510.05561,A general dark-state theory for arbitrary multilevel quantum systems,2025-10-07T04:14:14Z,"The dark-state effect, caused by destructive quantum interference, is an important physical effect in atomic physics and quantum optics. It not only deepens the understanding of light-atom interactions, but also has wide application in quantum physics and quantum information. Therefore, how to efficiently and conveniently determine the number and form of the dark states in multilevel quantum systems with complex transitions is an important and interesting topic in this field. In this work, we present a general theory for determining the dark states in multilevel quantum systems with any coupling configuration using the arrowhead-matrix method. To confirm the dark states in a multilevel system, we first define the upper- and lower-state subspaces, and then diagonalize the Hamiltonians restricted within the two subspaces to obtain the dressed upper and lower states. By further expressing the transitions between the dressed upper and lower states, we can map the multilevel system to a bipartite-graph network, in which the nodes and links are acted by the dressed states and transitions, respectively. Based on the coupling configurations of the network, we can determine the lower dark states with respect to the upper-state subspace. As examples, we analyze the dark states in three-, four-, and five-level quantum systems, for all possible configurations through the classification of the numbers of upper and lower states. Further, we extend the framework to multilevel quantum systems and discuss the existence of dark states in some typical configurations. We also recover the results of the dark-state polaritons in driven three-level systems with the arrowhead-matrix method. Our theory paves the way for manipulating and utilizing the dark states of multilevel quantum systems in modern quantum science and technology."
2510.05557,Fermionic Insights into Measurement-Based Quantum Computation: Circle   Graph States Are Not Universal Resources,2025-10-07T04:05:02Z,"Measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) is a strong contender for realizing quantum computers. A critical question for MBQC is the identification of resource graph states that can enable universal quantum computation. Any such universal family must have unbounded entanglement width, which is known to be equivalent to the ability to produce any circle graph state from the states in the family using only local Clifford operations, local Pauli measurements, and classical communication. Yet, it was not previously known whether or not circle graph states themselves are a universal resource. We show that, in spite of their expressivity, circle graph states are not efficiently universal for MBQC (i.e., assuming $\mathsf{BQP} \neq \mathsf{BPP}$). We prove this by articulating a precise graph-theoretic correspondence between circle graph states and a certain subset of fermionic Gaussian states. This is accomplished by synthesizing a variety of techniques that allow us to handle both stabilizer states and fermionic Gaussian states at the same time. As such, we anticipate that our developments may have broader applications beyond the domain of MBQC as well."
2510.05549,The code distance of Floquet codes,2025-10-07T03:27:48Z,"For fault-tolerant quantum memory defined by periodic Pauli measurements, called Floquet codes, we prove that every correctable, undetectable spacetime error occurring during the steady stage is a product of (i) measurement operators inserted at the time of the measurement and (ii) pairs of identical Pauli operators sandwiching a measurement that commutes with the operator. We call such errors benign; they define a binary vector subspace of spacetime errors which properly generalize stabilizers of static Pauli stabilizer codes. Hence, the code distance of a Floquet code is the minimal weight of an undetectable spacetime Pauli error that is not benign. Our results apply more generally to families of dynamical codes for which every instantaneous stabilizer is inferred from measurements in a time interval of bounded length."
2510.05531,Efficient learning of bosonic Gaussian unitaries,2025-10-07T02:42:40Z,"Bosonic Gaussian unitaries are fundamental building blocks of central continuous-variable quantum technologies such as quantum-optic interferometry and bosonic error-correction schemes. In this work, we present the first time-efficient algorithm for learning bosonic Gaussian unitaries with a rigorous analysis. Our algorithm produces an estimate of the unknown unitary that is accurate to small worst-case error, measured by the physically motivated energy-constrained diamond distance. Its runtime and query complexity scale polynomially with the number of modes, the inverse target accuracy, and natural energy parameters quantifying the allowed input energy and the unitary's output-energy growth.   The protocol uses only experimentally friendly photonic resources: coherent and squeezed probes, passive linear optics, and heterodyne/homodyne detection. We then employ an efficient classical post-processing routine that leverages a symplectic regularization step to project matrix estimates onto the symplectic group. In the limit of unbounded input energy, our procedure attains arbitrarily high precision using only $2m+2$ queries, where $m$ is the number of modes. To our knowledge, this is the first provably efficient learning algorithm for a multiparameter family of continuous-variable unitaries."
2510.05502,Full counting statistics of electron-photon hybrid systems: Joint   statistics and fluctuation symmetry,2025-10-07T01:45:12Z,"Electron-photon hybrid systems serve as ideal light-matter interfaces with broad applications in quantum technologies. These systems are typically operated dynamically under nonequilibrium conditions, giving rise to coupled electronic and photonic currents. Understanding the joint fluctuation behavior of these currents is essential for assessing the performance of light-matter interfaces that rely on electron-photon correlations. Here, we investigate the full counting statistics of coupled electronic and photonic currents in an experimentally feasible hybrid system composed of a double quantum dot coupled to an optical cavity. We employ the framework of quantum Lindblad master equation which is augmented with both electronic and photonic counting fields to derive their joint cumulant generating function--a treatment that differs significantly from existing studies, which typically focus on either electron or photon statistics separately. We reveal that the ratio between photonic and electronic currents, as well as their variances, can deviate from an expected quadratic scaling law in the large electron-photon coupling regime. Furthermore, we demonstrate that conventional modelings of photonic dissipation channels in quantum master equations must be modified to ensure that the joint cumulant generating function satisfies the fluctuation symmetry enforced by the fluctuation theorem. Our results advance the understanding of joint fluctuation behaviors in electron-photon hybrid systems and may inform the design of efficient quantum light-matter interfaces."
2510.05479,Cored product codes for quantum self-correction in three dimensions,2025-10-07T00:40:23Z,"The existence of self-correcting quantum memories in three dimensions is a long-standing open question at the interface between quantum computing and many-body physics. We take the perspective that large contributions to the entropy arising from fine-tuned spatial symmetries, including the assumption of an underlying regular lattice, are responsible for fundamental challenges to realizing self-correction. Accordingly, we introduce a class of disordered quantum codes, which we call ""cored product codes"". These codes are derived from classical factors via the hypergraph product but undergo a coring procedure which allows them to be embedded in a lower number of spatial dimensions while preserving code properties. As a specific example, we focus on a fractal code based on the aperiodic pinwheel tiling as the classical factor and perform finite temperature numerical simulations on the resulting three-dimensional quantum memory. We provide evidence that, below a critical temperature, the memory lifetime increases with system size for codes up to 60000 qubits."
2510.05475,From Classical Rationality to Contextual Reasoning: Quantum Logic as a   New Frontier for Human-Centric AI in Finance,2025-10-07T00:31:19Z,"We consider state of the art applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in modelling human financial expectations and explore the potential of quantum logic to drive future advancements in this field. This analysis highlights the application of machine learning techniques, including reinforcement learning and deep neural networks, in financial statement analysis, algorithmic trading, portfolio management, and robo-advisory services. We further discuss the emergence and progress of quantum machine learning (QML) and advocate for broader exploration of the advantages provided by quantum-inspired neural networks."
2510.05473,"Cryogenic growth of aluminum: structural morphology, optical properties,   superconductivity and microwave dielectric loss",2025-10-07T00:23:37Z,"We explore the molecular beam epitaxy synthesis of superconducting aluminum thin films grown on c-plane sapphire substrates at cryogenic temperatures of 6 K and compare their behavior with films synthesized at room temperature. We demonstrate that cryogenic growth increases structural disorder, producing crystalline grains that modify the optical, electrical, and superconducting properties of aluminum. We observe that cryogenic deposition changes the color of aluminum from fully reflective to yellow and correlate the pseudo-dielectric function and reflectance with structural changes in the film. We find that smaller grain sizes enhance the superconductivity of aluminum, increasing its critical temperature and critical field. We then estimate the superconducting gap and coherence length of Cooper pairs in aluminum in the presence of disorder. Finally, we fabricate superconducting microwave resonators on these films and find that, independently of the growth temperature, the system is dominated by two-level system loss with similar quality factors in the high and low power regimes. We further measure a higher kinetic inductance in the cryogenically grown films."
2510.05472,Quantum Regression Theory and Efficient Computation of Response   Functions for Non-Markovian Open Systems,2025-10-07T00:23:33Z,"Linear response functions are a cornerstone concept in physics as they enable efficient estimation of many dynamical properties. In addition to predicting dynamics of observables under perturbations without resimulating the system, these response functions lead to electric conductivity, magnetic susceptibility, dielectric constants, etc. Estimating two-time correlation functions is a key ingredient of measuring linear response functions. However, for open quantum systems, simulating the reduced density operator with a quantum master equation only yields \emph{one-point} observables and is insufficient for this task. In this paper, we develop a memoryless, system-only formulation of two-point correlations for open quantum systems that extends the standard quantum regression theorem (QRT) beyond the Markov limit. We further incorporate the spectral property of the bath and express the time propagators in the response function as the memoryless generators in Lindblad-type forms. The resulting expressions recast the total response function into evolutions generated by time-dependent Hamiltonian and Lindblad primitives together with the more challenging propagation of commutators and anti-commutators. In addition to the derivation of the new QRT, we present quantum algorithms for these primitives and obtain an estimator for two-time correlations whose cost scales poly-logarithmically in the system dimension and $1/\epsilon^{1.25}$ in the target accuracy $\epsilon$. The framework removes the separability (Born-Markov) assumption and offers a pathway to efficient computation of nonequilibrium properties from open quantum systems."
2510.05471,AC magnetometry in the strong drive regime with NV centers in diamond,2025-10-07T00:17:08Z,"Magnetic response measurements in the presence of AC drive fields provide critical insight into the properties of magnetic and conductive materials, such as phase transitions in two-dimensional van der Waals magnets, the heating efficiency of magnetic nanoparticles in biological environments, and the integrity of metals in eddy current testing. Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are a commonly-used platform for such studies, due to their high spatial resolution and sensitivity, but are typically limited to weak-drive conditions, i.e., AC drive fields well below the NV microwave (MW) pulse Rabi strength. Once the AC drive field grows comparable to or larger than the Rabi strength, the induced MW pulse detuning suppresses NV sensitivity to the out-of-phase magnetic response, which encodes dissipation and conductivity in materials of interest. Here, we introduce a phase modulation protocol that cancels MW pulse detuning to leading order, and extends NV AC magnetometry into the strong drive field regime. The protocol, termed SIPHT (Signal Isolation through PHase Tuning), is experimentally demonstrated using an NV ensemble. By directly comparing SIPHT to the conventional Hahn echo AC sensing protocol, we quantify the preservation of NV magnetometry contrast for an out-of-phase signal. We further showcase SIPHT by detecting eddy current-induced magnetic fields from Cu, Al, and Ti samples, with the measured response field phase delays reflecting their distinct conductivities. SIPHT extends NV AC magnetometry to regimes inaccessible to standard dynamical decoupling measurement protocols, unlocking novel utility, e.g., in the study of magnetic hyperthermia and nondestructive testing of conductors."
2510.05406,Photoswitchable radicals as reporter spins for quantum sensing with spin   defects in diamond,2025-10-06T21:55:05Z,"The rapid decay of target signal strength with distance from the sensor presents a key challenge in nanoscale magnetic sensing with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, limiting both sensitivity and spatial resolution. Here we introduce a strategy to overcome this limitation by using radical anions formed from rhodamine-derived dyes as reporter spins localized to the diamond surface. These radicals, generated through photoreduction, are optically identifiable and stable on timescales exceeding an hour. We experimentally demonstrate their coherent manipulation and detection using single, shallow NV centers for readout. We observe heterogeneity in the local magnetic environments of the photoactivated spins from site to site, likely due to variations in inter-radical couplings across our measurements. Looking forward, our approach enables correlative nanoscale magnetic and optical imaging, and opens new pathways toward single-molecule magnetic resonance studies."
2510.05405,Observation of Genuine Tripartite Non-Gaussian Entanglement from a   Superconducting Three-Photon Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion Source,2025-10-06T21:53:31Z,"The generation of entangled photons through Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) is a critical resource for many key experiments and technologies in the domain of quantum optics. Historically, SPDC was limited to the generation of photon pairs. However, the use of the strong nonlinearities in circuit quantum electrodynamics has recently enabled the observation of Three-Photon SPDC (3P-SPDC). Despite great interest in the entanglement structure of the resultant states, entanglement between photon triplets produced by a 3P-SPDC source has still has not been confirmed. Here, we report on the observation of genuine tripartite non-Gaussian entanglement in the steady-state output field of a 3P-SPDC source consisting of a superconducting parametric cavity coupled to a transmission line. We study this non-Gaussian tripartite entanglement using an entanglement witness built from three-mode correlation functions, and observe a maximum violation of the bound by 23 standard deviations of the statistical noise. Furthermore, we find strong agreement between the observed and the analytically predicted scaling of the entanglement witness. We then explore the impact of the temporal function used to define the photon mode on the observed value of the entanglement witness."
2510.05393,On Limits on the Provable Consequences of Quantum Pseudorandomness,2025-10-06T21:38:04Z,"There are various notions of quantum pseudorandomness, such as pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs), pseudorandom state generators (PRSGs) and pseudorandom function-like state generators (PRSFGs). Unlike the different notions of classical pseudorandomness, which are known to be existentially equivalent to each other, the relation between quantum pseudorandomness has yet to be fully established.   We present some evidence suggesting that some quantum pseudorandomness is unlikely to be constructed from the others, or at least is hard to construct unless some conjectures are false. This indicates that quantum pseudorandomness could behave quite differently from classical pseudorandomness. We study new oracle worlds where one quantum pseudorandomness exists but another pseudorandomness does not under some assumptions or constraints, and provide potential directions to achieve the full black-box separation. More precisely:   - We give a unitary oracle relative to which PRFSGs exist but PRUs without using ancilla do not. This can be extended to the general PRUs if we can prove a structural property of the PRU algorithm.   - Assuming an isoperimetric inequality-style conjecture, we show a unitary oracle world where log-length output PRFSGs exist but proving the existence of quantum-computable pseudorandom generators (QPRGs) with negligible correctness error is as hard as proving that ${\sf BQP}\neq {\sf QCMA}$. This result suggests that the inverse-polynomial error in the state of the art construction of QPRGs from log-length PRSGs is inherent.   - Assuming the same conjecture, we prove that some natural way of constructing super-log-length output PRSGs from log-length output PRFSGs is impossible. This partly complements the known hardness of shrinking the PRSG output lengths. Along the way, we also discuss other potential approaches to extend the PRSG output lengths."
2510.05391,Quantum Concept Music Score from Quantum Picturalism: Musical   Incarnation of a Bell-Pair under Measurements,2025-10-06T21:35:06Z,"We initiate the development of a new language and theory for quantum music, to which we refer as Quantum Concept Music (QCM). This new music formalism is based on Categorical Quantum Mechanics (CQM), and more specifically, its diagrammatic incarnation Quantum Picturalism (QPict), which is heavily based on ZX-calculus. In fact, it is naturally inherited from CQM/QPict. At its heart is the explicit notational representation of relations that exist within and between the key concepts of music composition, performance, and automation. QCM also enables one to directly translate quantum phenomena into music compositions in a both intuitively obvious, rigorous and mechanical manner.   Following this pattern, we propose a score for musicians interacting like a Bell-pair under measurement, and outline examples of how it could be live performed. While most of the Western classical music notation has heavily relied on linear representation of music - which does not always adequately capture the nature of music - our approach is distinct by highlighting the fundamental relational dimension of music. In addition, this quantum-based technique not only influences the music at the profound level of composition, but also has a direct impact on a live performance, and also provides a new template for automating music, e.g.~in the context of AI-generation.   All together, we initiate the creation of new music formalism that is powerful and efficient in capturing the interactive nature of music, both in terms of internal and external interactions, and goes beyond the boundaries of Western classical music notation, which allows to use it in many different genres and directions."
2510.05384,Levitated optomechanics with cylindrically polarized vortex beams,2025-10-06T21:21:40Z,"Optically levitated and cooled nanoparticles are a new quantum system whose application to the creation of non-classical states of motion and quantum limited sensing is fundamentally limited by recoil and bulk heating. We study the creation of stable 3D optical traps using optical cylindrically polarized vortex beams with radial and azimuthal polarization and show that a significant reduction in recoil heating by up to an order of magnitude can be achieved when compared with conventional single Gaussian beam tweezers. Additionally these beams allow trapping of larger particles outside the Rayleigh regime using both bright and dark tweezer trapping with reduced recoil heating. By changing the wavelength of the trapping laser, or the size of the particles, non-linear and repulsive potentials of interest for the creation of non-classical states of motion can also be created."
2510.05346,Exact Quench Dynamics from Thermal Pure Quantum States,2025-10-06T20:13:05Z,"We present an exact solution for a quantum quench in an integrable system that reveals a new, coherent pathway to thermalization. In chaotic systems, thermalization is understood via the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which implies that a quench from a thermal pure quantum (TPQ) state should exhibit trivial dynamics. In contrast, integrable systems are expected to retain memory of their initial conditions in a non-thermal generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE). We show that a quench from a TPQ state in the integrable spin-1/2 XX chain defies both expectations. The system thermalizes to a canonical Gibbs ensemble, yet the entanglement dynamics are highly non-trivial, exhibiting a ""double plateau"" structure. We solve this process exactly using techniques in two-dimensional (2D) conformal field theories (CFT), an exact numerical method based on the matrix Riccati equation, and an asymptotically exact quasiparticle picture. We prove that the non-trivial dynamics are the macroscopic signature of the coherent dephasing of the initial state's anomalous pairing correlations."
2510.05316,A New Approach to Arguments of Quantum Knowledge,2025-10-06T19:29:25Z,"We construct a non-interactive zero-knowledge argument system for QMA with the following properties of interest.   1. Transparent setup. Our protocol only requires a uniformly random string (URS) setup. The only prior (publicly-verifiable) NIZK for QMA (Bartusek and Malavolta, ITCS 2022) requires an entire obfuscated program as the common reference string.   2. Extractability. Valid QMA witnesses can be extracted directly from our accepting proofs. That is, we obtain an argument of knowledge, which was previously only known in a secret parameters model (Coladangelo, Vidick, and Zhang, CRYPTO 2020).   At the heart of our construction is a novel application of the coset state authentication scheme from (Bartusek, Brakerski, and Vaikuntanathan, STOC 2024) to the setting of QMA verification. Along the way, we establish new properties of the authentication scheme, and design a new type of ZX QMA verifier with ``strong completeness.'' The security of our construction rests on the heuristic use of a post-quantum indistinguishability obfuscator. However, rather than rely on the full-fledged classical oracle model (i.e. ideal obfuscation), we isolate a particular game-based property of the obfuscator that suffices for our proof, which we dub the evasive composability heuristic. Going a step further, we show how to replace the heuristic use of an obfuscator with the heuristic use of a hash function (plus sub-exponentially secure functional encryption). We accomplish this by establishing security of the ideal obfuscation scheme of Jain, Lin, Luo, and Wichs (CRYPTO 2023) in the quantum pseudorandom oracle model, which can be heuristically instantiated with a hash function. This result is of independent interest, and allows us to translate several quantum-cryptographic results that were only known in the classical oracle model to results in the quantum pseudorandom oracle model."
2510.05289,Overshifted Parameter-Shift Rules: Optimizing Complex Quantum Systems   with Few Measurements,2025-10-06T18:56:57Z,"Gradient-based optimization is a key ingredient of variational quantum algorithms, with applications ranging from quantum machine learning to quantum chemistry and simulation. The parameter-shift rule provides a hardware-friendly method for evaluating gradients of expectation values with respect to circuit parameters, but its applicability is limited to circuits whose gate generators have a particular spectral structure. In this work, we present a generalized framework that, with optimal minimum measurement overhead, extends parameter shift rules beyond this restrictive setting to encompass basically arbitrary gate generator, possibly made of complex multi-qubit interactions with unknown spectrum and, in some settings, even infinite dimensional systems such as those describing photonic devices or qubit-oscillator systems. Our generalization enables the use of more expressive quantum circuits in variational quantum optimization and enlarges its scope by harnessing all the available hardware degrees of freedom."
2510.05262,Peaked quantum advantage using error correction,2025-10-06T18:31:10Z,"A key issue of current quantum advantage experiments is that their verification requires a full classical simulation of the ideal computation. This limits the regime in which the experiments can be verified to precisely the regime in which they are also simulatable. An important outstanding question is therefore to find quantum advantage schemes that are also classically verifiable. We make progress on this question by designing a new quantum advantage proposal--Hidden Code Sampling--whose output distribution is conditionally peaked. These peaks enable verification in far less time than it takes for full simulation. At the same time, we show that exactly sampling from the output distribution is classically hard unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses, and we propose a plausible conjecture regarding average-case hardness. Our scheme is based on ideas from quantum error correction. The required quantum computations are closely related to quantum fault-tolerant circuits and can potentially be implemented transversally. Our proposal may thus give rise to a next generation of quantum advantage experiments en route to full quantum fault tolerance."
2510.05242,Variational and field-theoretical approach to exciton-exciton   interactions and biexcitons in semiconductors,2025-10-06T18:07:48Z,"Bound electron-hole pairs in semiconductors known as excitons are the subject of intense research due to their potential for optoelectronic devices and applications, especially in the realm of two-dimensional materials. While the properties of free excitons in these systems are well understood, a general description of their interactions is complicated due to their composite nature, which leads to exchange between the identical fermions of different excitons. In this work we employ a variational approach to study interactions between Wannier excitons and obtain an effective interaction potential between two ground-state excitons in a system of spin-degenerate electrons and holes. This potential is in general nonlocal and depends on the coupled spins of the particles. When particularized to hydrogen-like excitons with a heavy hole, it becomes local and exactly reproduces the Heitler-London result for two interacting hydrogen atoms. Thus, our result can be interpreted as a generalization of the Heitler-London potential to arbitrary masses. Including corrections due to excited states results in a van der Waals potential at large distances, which is expected due to the induced dipole-dipole nature of the interactions. Additionally, we use a path-integral formalism to develop a many-body theory for a gas of excitons, resulting in an excitonic action that formally includes many-body interactions between excitons. While in the field representing the excitons is exactly bosonic, we clarify how the internal exchange processes arise in the field-theoretical treatment, and show that the diagrams corresponding to the interactions between excitons align with our variational calculation when evaluated on shell. Our methods and results lay the groundwork for a generalized theory of exciton-exciton interactions and their application to the study of biexciton spectra and correlated excitonic matter."
2510.05225,Dynamical quantum codes and logic gates on a lattice with sparse   connectivity,2025-10-06T18:00:49Z,"We introduce several dynamical schemes that take advantage of mid-circuit measurement and nearest-neighbor gates on a lattice with maximum vertex degree three to implement topological codes and perform logic gates between them. We first review examples of Floquet codes and their implementation with nearest-neighbor gates and ancillary qubits. Next, we describe implementations of these Floquet codes that make use of the ancillary qubits to reset all qubits every measurement cycle. We then show how switching the role of data and ancilla qubits allows a pair of Floquet codes to be implemented simultaneously. We describe how to perform a logical Clifford gate to entangle a pair of Floquet codes that are implemented in this way. Finally, we show how switching between the color code and a pair of Floquet codes, via a depth-two circuit followed by mid-circuit measurement, can be used to perform syndrome extraction for the color code."
2510.05226,Spin-spiral instability of the Nagaoka ferromagnet in the crossover   between square and triangular lattices,2025-10-06T18:00:49Z,"We study the hard-core Fermi-Hubbard model in the crossover between square and triangular lattices near half-filling. As was recognized by Nagaoka in the 1960s, on the square lattice the presence of a single hole leads to ferromagnetic spin ordering. On the triangular lattice, geometric frustration instead leads to a spin-singlet ground state, which can be associated with a 120-degree spiral order. On lattices which interpolate between square and triangular, there is a phase transition at which the ferromagnetic order becomes unstable to a spin spiral. We model this instability, finding the exact critical point."
2510.05227,TeMFpy: a Python library for converting fermionic mean-field states into   tensor networks,2025-10-06T18:00:49Z,"We introduce TeMFpy, a Python library for converting fermionic mean-field states to finite or infinite matrix product state (MPS) form. TeMFpy includes new, efficient, and easy-to-understand algorithms for both Slater determinants and Pfaffian states. Together with Gutzwiller projection, these also allow the user to build variational wave functions for various strongly correlated electron systems, such as quantum spin liquids. We present all implemented algorithms in detail and describe how they can be accessed through TeMFpy, including full example workflows. TeMFpy is built on top of TeNPy and, therefore, integrates seamlessly with existing MPS-based algorithms."
2510.05221,Fault-tolerant interfaces for modular quantum computing on diverse qubit   platforms,2025-10-06T18:00:47Z,"Modular architectures offer a scalable path toward fault-tolerant quantum computing by interconnecting smaller quantum processing units (QPUs) provided that high-rate, fault-tolerant interfaces can be realized across modules. We present a comprehensive analysis and comparison of known and new methods for establishing such interfaces, including lattice surgery, transversal gates, and novel grow-and-distil protocols based on code growing and logical distillation. Using the surface code, we identify optimal interface strategies across a wide range of hardware parameters, such as gate fidelities, entangling rates, and memory resources, and estimate the requirements to achieve logical error rates of $10^{-6}$ and $10^{-12}$. Our results establish when the interface become a bottleneck in the computation and provide guidance for experimental implementations with superconducting, atomic, and solid-state hardware."
2510.05222,Scalable accuracy gains from postselection in quantum error correcting   codes,2025-10-06T18:00:47Z,"Decoding stabilizer codes such as the surface and toric codes involves evaluating free-energy differences in a disordered statistical mechanics model, in which the randomness comes from the observed pattern of error syndromes. We study the statistical distribution of logical failure rates across observed syndromes in the toric code, and show that, within the coding phase, logical failures are predominantly caused by exponentially unlikely syndromes. Therefore, postselecting on not seeing these exponentially unlikely syndrome patterns offers a scalable accuracy gain. In general, the logical error rate can be suppressed from $p_f$ to $p_f^b$, where $b \geq 2$ in general; in the specific case of the toric code with perfect syndrome measurements, we find numerically that $b = 3.1(1)$. Our arguments apply to general topological stabilizer codes, and can be extended to more general settings as long as the decoding failure probability obeys a large deviation principle."
2510.05212,Effects of intertube dipole-dipole interactions in nearly integrable   one-dimensional $^{162}$Dy gases,2025-10-06T18:00:37Z,"We study the effects of the intertube dipole-dipole interactions (DDI) in recent experiments with arrays of nearly integrable one-dimensional (1D) dipolar Bose gases of $^{162}$Dy atoms. An earlier theoretical modeling ignored those interactions, which we include here via a modification of the 1D confining potentials. We investigate the effects of the intertube DDI both during the state preparation and during the measurements of the rapidity distributions. We explore how the strength of the contact interactions and the magnetic field angles modify the intertube DDI corrections. We find that those corrections slightly change both the properties of the equilibrium state and the rapidity measurements. Remarkably, however, the changes nearly cancel each other, resulting in measured rapidity distributions that are very close to those predicted in the absence of the intertube DDI."
2510.05211,Self-dual bivariate bicycle codes with transversal Clifford gates,2025-10-06T18:00:35Z,"Bivariate bicycle codes are promising candidates for high-threshold, low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum memories. Meanwhile, color codes are the most prominent self-dual CSS codes, supporting transversal Clifford gates that have been demonstrated experimentally. In this work, we combine these advantages and introduce a broad family of self-dual bivariate bicycle codes. These codes achieve higher encoding rates than surface and color codes while admitting transversal CNOT, Hadamard, and $S$ gates. In particular, we enumerate weight-8 self-dual bivariate bicycle codes with up to $n \leq 200$ physical qubits, realized on twisted tori that enhance code distance and improve stabilizer locality. Representative examples include codes with parameters $[[n,k,d]]$: $[[16,4,4]]$, $[[40,6,6]]$, $[[56,6,8]]$, $[[64,8,8]]$, $[[120,8,12]]$, $[[152,6,16]]$, and $[[160,8,16]]$."
2510.05203,Randomness from causally independent processes,2025-10-06T18:00:03Z,"We consider a pair of causally independent processes, modelled as the tensor product of two channels, acting on a possibly correlated input to produce random outputs X and Y. We show that, assuming the processes produce a sufficient amount of randomness, one can extract uniform randomness from X and Y. This generalizes prior results, which assumed that X and Y are (conditionally) independent. Note that in contrast to the independence of quantum states, the independence of channels can be enforced through spacelike separation. As a consequence, our results allow for the generation of randomness under more practical and physically justifiable assumptions than previously possible. We illustrate this with the example of device-independent randomness amplification, where we can remove the constraint that the adversary only has access to classical side information about the source."
2510.05198,Intrinsically Quantum Effects of Axion Dark Matter are Undetectable,2025-10-06T18:00:00Z,"Is the usual treatment of axion dark matter as a classical field reliable? We show that the answer is subtle: the axion field could well be in a quantum state that has no complete classical description, but realistic detectors cannot tell the difference. To see this, we solve a fully quantum model of axion detection using quantum optics techniques. We show that intrinsically quantum effects are washed out by mode averaging or small amounts of noise, and significantly suppressed by the weakness of the axion coupling. Our work exemplifies that there should always be a classical analog for axion dark matter effects, extends to other wave (ultralight) dark-matter candidates, and gives a general method to compute the effects of exotic dark-matter states."
2510.05099,Simulating fermions with exponentially lower overhead,2025-10-06T17:59:13Z,"Simulating time evolution under fermionic Hamiltonians is a compelling application of quantum computers because it lies at the core of predicting the properties of materials and molecules. Fermions can be simulated on qubit-based quantum computers using a fermion-to-qubit mapping, subject to an overhead -- the circuit depth on a qubit quantum computer divided by that on a quantum computer built from native fermionic modes -- at worst scaling linearly with the number of modes $N$. Existing approaches that lower this depth overhead usually trade it for space, using $O(N)$ ancilla qubits. We exponentially reduce the worst-case overhead of ancilla-free fermion-to-qubit mappings to $O(\log^2 N)$ by constructing circuits that perform any fermionic permutation on qubits in the Jordan-Wigner encoding in depth $O(\log^2 N)$. We also show that our result generalizes to permutations in any product-preserving ternary tree fermionic encoding. When introducing $O(N)$ ancillas and mid-circuit measurement and feedforward, the overhead reduces to $O(\log N)$. Finally, we show that our scheme can be used to implement the fermionic fast Fourier transform, a key subroutine in chemistry simulation, with overhead $\Theta(\log N)$ without ancillas and $\Theta(1)$ with ancillas, improving exponentially over the best previously known ancilla-free algorithm with overhead scaling linearly with $N$. Our results show that simulating fermions with qubit quantum computers comes at a much lower asymptotic overhead than previously thought."
2510.05089,"QuantumBoost: A lazy, yet fast, quantum algorithm for learning with weak   hypotheses",2025-10-06T17:56:05Z,"The technique of combining multiple votes to enhance the quality of a decision is the core of boosting algorithms in machine learning. In particular, boosting provably increases decision quality by combining multiple weak learners-hypotheses that are only slightly better than random guessing-into a single strong learner that classifies data well. There exist various versions of boosting algorithms, which we improve upon through the introduction of QuantumBoost. Inspired by classical work by Barak, Hardt and Kale, our QuantumBoost algorithm achieves the best known runtime over other boosting methods through two innovations. First, it uses a quantum algorithm to compute approximate Bregman projections faster. Second, it combines this with a lazy projection strategy, a technique from convex optimization where projections are performed infrequently rather than every iteration. To our knowledge, QuantumBoost is the first algorithm, classical or quantum, to successfully adopt a lazy projection strategy in the context of boosting."
2510.05088,Casimir Stabilization of Fluctuating Electronic Nematic Order,2025-10-06T17:56:01Z,"Vacuum cavity control of quantum materials is the engineering of quantum materials systems through electromagnetic zero-point fluctuations. In this work we articulate a generic mechanism for vacuum optical control of correlated electronic order: Casimir control, where the zero-point energy of the electromagnetic continuum, the Casimir energy, depends on the properties of the material system. To assess the experimental viability of this mechanism we focus on the Casimir stabilization of fluctuating nematic order. In nematic Fermi liquids, different orientations of the electronic order are often energetically degenerate. Thus, while local domains of fixed orientation may form, thermal disordering inhibits long range order. By engineering the electromagnetic environment of the electronic system, however, we show that the Casimir energy can be used as a tool to preferentially stabilize particular orientations of the nematic order. As a concrete example, we examine the interplay between a birefringent crystal -- which sources an anisotropic electromagnetic environment -- and a quantum Hall stripe system, an archetypal nematic Fermi fluid. We show that for experimentally feasible setups, the anisotropy induced by the orientation dependent Casimir energy can be $10^4$ times larger than other mechanisms known to stabilize quantum Hall stripes. This finding convincingly implies that our setting may be realized with currently available experimental technology. Having demonstrated that the Casimir energy can be used to stabilize fluctuating nematic order, we close by discussing the implications for recent terahertz cavity experiments on quantum Hall stripes, as well as pave the road towards broader Casimir control of competing correlated electronic phases."
2510.05082,On the Cryptographic Foundations of Interactive Quantum Advantage,2025-10-06T17:51:22Z,"In this work, we study the hardness required to achieve proofs of quantumness (PoQ), which in turn capture (potentially interactive) quantum advantage. A ``trivial'' PoQ is to simply assume an average-case hard problem for classical computers that is easy for quantum computers. However, there is much interest in ``non-trivial'' PoQ that actually rely on quantum hardness assumptions, as these are often a starting point for more sophisticated protocols such as classical verification of quantum computation (CVQC). We show several lower-bounds for the hardness required to achieve non-trivial PoQ, specifically showing that they likely require cryptographic hardness, with different types of cryptographic hardness being required for different variations of non-trivial PoQ. In particular, our results help explain the challenges in using lattices to build publicly verifiable PoQ and its various extensions such as CVQC."
2510.05074,Engineering the uncontrollable: Steering noisy spin-correlated   radical-pairs with coherent and incoherent control,2025-10-06T17:48:49Z,"The quantum control of spin-correlated radical pairs (SCRPs) holds promise for the targeted manipulation of magnetic field effects, with potential applications ranging from the design of noise-resilient quantum information processors to genetically encodable quantum sensors. However, achieving precise handles over the intricate interplay between coherent electron spin dynamics and incoherent relaxation processes in photoexcited radical-pair reactions requires tractable approaches for numerically obtaining controls for large, complex open quantum systems. Employing techniques relying on full Liouville-space propagators becomes computationally infeasible for large spin systems of realistic complexity. Here, we demonstrate how a control engineering approach based on the Pontryagin Maximum Principle (PMP) can offer a viable alternative by reporting on the successful application of PMP-optimal control to steer the coherent and incoherent spin dynamics of noisy radical pairs. This enables controls for prototypical radical-pair models that exhibit robustness in the face of relevant noise sources and paves the way to incoherent control of radical-pair spin dynamics."
2510.05072,The role of entropy production and thermodynamic uncertainty relations   in the thermalization of open quantum systems,2025-10-06T17:48:01Z,"The asymmetry between heating and cooling in open quantum systems is a hallmark of nonequilibrium dynamics, yet its thermodynamic origin has remained unclear. Here, we investigate the thermalization of a quantum system weakly coupled to a thermal bath, focusing on the entropy production rate and the quantum thermokinetic uncertainty relation (TKUR). We derive an analytical expression for the entropy production rate, showing that heating begins with a higher entropy production, which drives faster thermalization than cooling. The quantum TKUR links this asymmetry to heat current fluctuations, demonstrating that larger entropy production suppresses fluctuations, making heating more stable than cooling. Our results reveal the thermodynamic basis of asymmetric thermalization and highlight uncertainty relations as key to nonequilibrium quantum dynamics."
2510.05055,On the Cryptographic Futility of Non-Collapsing Measurements,2025-10-06T17:36:22Z,"We investigate quantum analogues of collision resistance and obtain separations between quantum ``one-way'' and ``collision-resistant'' primitives.   1. Our first result studies one-wayness versus collision-resistance defined over quantum circuits that output classical strings. We show that there is a classical oracle $\mathcal{O}$ relative to which (sub-exponentially secure) indistinguishability obfuscation and one-way permutations exist even against adversaries that make quantum queries to a non-collapsing measurement oracle, $\mathcal{Q}^{\mathcal{O}}$. Very roughly, $\mathcal{Q}^{\mathcal{O}}$ outputs the result of multiple non-collapsing measurements on the output of any quantum $\mathcal{O}$-aided circuit.   This rules out fully black-box {\em quantum} constructions of $Y$ from $X$ for any $X \in \{$indistinguishability obfuscation and one-way permutations, public-key encryption, deniable encryption, oblivious transfer, non-interactive ZK, trapdoor permutations, quantum money$\}, Y \in \{$collision-resistant hash functions, hard problems in SZK, homomorphic encryption, distributional collision-resistant puzzles$\}$.   2. Our second result studies one-wayness versus collision-resistance defined over quantum states. Here, we show that relative to the same classical oracle $\mathcal{O}$, (sub-exponentially secure) indistinguishability obfuscation and one-way permutations exist even against adversaries that make quantum queries to a {\em cloning unitary} $\mathsf{QCol}^\mathcal{O}$. Very roughly, this latter oracle implements a well-defined, linear operation to clone a subset of the qubits output by any quantum $\mathcal{O}$-aided circuit.   This rules out fully black-box constructions of quantum lightning from public-key quantum money."
2510.05032,One rig to control them all,2025-10-06T17:09:21Z,"We introduce a theory for computational control, consisting of seven naturally interpretable equations. Adding these to a prop of base circuits constructs controlled circuits, borne out in examples of reversible Boolean circuits and quantum circuits.

2510.05028,"On Cryptography and Distribution Verification, with Applications to   Quantum Advantage",2025-10-06T17:05:38Z,"One of the most fundamental problems in the field of hypothesis testing is the identity testing problem: whether samples from some unknown distribution $\mathcal{G}$ are actually from some explicit distribution $\mathcal{D}$. It is known that when the distribution $\mathcal{D}$ has support $[N]$, the optimal sample complexity for the identity testing problem is roughly $O(\sqrt{N})$. However, many distributions of interest, including those which can be sampled efficiently, have exponential support size, and therefore the optimal identity tester also requires exponential samples. In this paper, we bypass this lower bound by considering restricted settings. The above $O(\sqrt{N})$ sample complexity identity tester is constructed so that it is not fooled by any (even inefficiently-sampled) distributions. However, in most applications, the distributions under consideration are efficiently sampleable, and therefore it is enough to consider only identity testers that are not fooled by efficiently-sampled distributions. In that case, we can focus on efficient verification with efficient identity testers. We investigate relations between efficient verifications of classical/quantum distributions and classical/quantum cryptography, and show the following results: (i) Every quantumly samplable distribution is verifiable with a $\mathbf{P^{PP}}$ algorithm. (ii) If one-way functions exist, then no sufficiently random classically samplable distribution is efficiently verifiable. (iii) If one-way functions do not exist, then every classically samplable distribution is efficiently verifiable. (iv) If QEFID pairs exist, then there exists a quantumly samplable distribution which is not efficiently verifiable. (v) If one-way puzzles do not exist, then it is possible to verify sampling-based quantum advantage with a efficient quantum computer."
2510.05010,Optimización de la Transmisión de Estados Cuánticos en Cadenas de   Qubits usando Deep Reinforcement Learning y Algoritmos Genéticos,2025-10-06T16:52:21Z,"Quantum state transfer (QST) via homogeneous spin chains plays a crucial role in building scalable quantum hardware. A basic quantum state transmission protocol prepares a state in one qubit and transfers it to another through a channel, seeking to minimize the time and avoid information loss. The fidelity of the process is measured by functions proportional to the transition probability between both states. We approach this optimization problem using constant magnetic pulses and two complementary strategies: deep reinforcement learning, where an agent learns pulse sequences through rewards, and genetic algorithms, which develop candidate solutions through selection and mutation. We analyze the efficiency of both methods and their ability to incorporate physical constraints."
2510.05008,Correcting quantum errors using a classical code and one additional   qubit,2025-10-06T16:52:05Z,"Classical error-correcting codes are powerful but incompatible with quantum noise, which includes both bit-flips and phase-flips. We introduce Hadamard-based Virtual Error Correction (H-VEC), a protocol that empowers any classical bit-flip code to correct arbitrary Pauli noise with the addition of only a single ancilla qubit and two layers of controlled-Hadamard gates. Through classical post-processing, H-VEC virtually filters the error channel, projecting the noise into pure Y-type errors that are subsequently corrected using the classical code's native decoding algorithm. We demonstrate this by applying H-VEC to the classical repetition code. Under a code-capacity noise model, the resulting protocol not only provides full quantum protection but also achieves an exponentially stronger error suppression (in distance) than the original classical code, and even larger improvements over the surface code while using much fewer qubits, simpler checks and straight-forward decoding. H-VEC comes with a sampling overhead due to its post-processing nature. It represents a new hybrid quantum error correction and mitigation framework that redefines the trade-offs between physical hardware requirements and classical processing for error suppression."
2510.04993,Characterization of permutation gates in the third level of the Clifford   hierarchy,2025-10-06T16:28:35Z,"The Clifford hierarchy is a fundamental structure in quantum computation whose mathematical properties are not fully understood. In this work, we characterize permutation gates -- unitaries which permute the $2^n$ basis states -- in the third level of the hierarchy. We prove that any permutation gate in the third level must be a product of Toffoli gates in what we define as \emph{staircase form}, up to left and right multiplications by Clifford permutations. We then present necessary and sufficient conditions for a staircase form permutation gate to be in the third level of the Clifford hierarchy. As a corollary, we construct a family of non-semi-Clifford permutation gates $\{U_k\}_{k\geq 3}$ in staircase form such that each $U_k$ is in the third level but its inverse is not in the $k$-th level."
2510.04992,Less is More: On Copy Complexity in Quantum Cryptography,2025-10-06T16:28:23Z,"Quantum cryptographic definitions are often sensitive to the number of copies of the cryptographic states revealed to an adversary. Making definitional changes to the number of copies accessible to an adversary can drastically affect various aspects including the computational hardness, feasibility, and applicability of the resulting cryptographic scheme. This phenomenon appears in many places in quantum cryptography, including quantum pseudorandomness and unclonable cryptography. To address this, we present a generic approach to boost single-copy security to multi-copy security and apply this approach to many settings. As a consequence, we obtain the following new results: -One-copy stretch pseudorandom state generators (under mild assumptions) imply the existence of t-copy stretch pseudorandom state generators, for any fixed polynomial t. -One-query pseudorandom unitaries with short keys (under mild assumptions) imply the existence of t-query pseudorandom unitaries with short keys, for any fixed polynomial t. -Assuming indistinguishability obfuscation and other standard cryptographic assumptions, there exist identical-copy secure unclonable primitives such as public-key quantum money and quantum copy-protection."
2510.04973,Quantum walks through generalized graph composition,2025-10-06T16:07:20Z,"In this work, we generalize the recently-introduced graph composition framework to the non-boolean setting. A quantum algorithm in this framework is represented by a hypergraph, where each hyperedge is adjacent to multiple vertices. The input and output to the quantum algorithm is represented by a set of boundary vertices, and the hyperedges act like switches, connecting the input vertex to the output that the algorithm computes.   Apart from generalizing the graph composition framework, our new proposed framework unifies the quantum divide and conquer framework, the decision-tree framework, and the unified quantum walk search framework. For the decision trees, we additionally construct a quantum algorithm from an improved weighting scheme in the non-boolean case. For quantum walk search, we show how our techniques naturally allow for amortization of the subroutines' costs. Previous work showed how one can speed up ``detection'' of marked vertices by amortizing the costs of the quantum walk. In this work, we extend these results to the setting of ``finding'' such marked vertices, albeit in some restricted settings.   Along the way, we provide a novel analysis of irreducible, reversible Markov processes, by linear-algebraically connecting its effective resistance to the random walk operator. This significantly simplifies the algorithmic implementation of the quantum walk search algorithm, achieves an amortization speed-up for quantum walks over Johnson graphs, avoids the need for quantum fast-forwarding, and removes the log-factors from the query complexity statements."
2510.04967,Quantum Filtering at Finite Temperature,2025-10-06T16:00:37Z,"We pose and solve the problem of quantum filtering based on continuous-in-time quadrature measurements (homodyning) for the case where the quantum process is in a thermal state. The standard construction of quantum filters involves the determination of the conditional expectation onto the von Neumann algebra generated by the measured observables with the non-demolition principle telling us to restrict the domain (the observables to be estimated) to the commutant of the algebra. The finite-temperature case, however, has additional structure: we use the Araki-Woods representation for the measured quadratures, but the Tomita-Takesaki theory tells us that there exists a separate, commuting representation and therefore the commutant will have a richer structure than encountered in the Fock vacuum case. We apply this to the question of quantum trajectories to the Davies-Fulling-Unruh model. Here, the two representations are interpreted as the fields in the right and left Rindler wedges."
2510.04954,Rapid Mixing of Quantum Gibbs Samplers for Weakly-Interacting Quantum   Systems,2025-10-06T15:54:05Z,"Dissipative quantum algorithms for state preparation in many-body systems are increasingly recognised as promising candidates for achieving large quantum advantages in application-relevant tasks. Recent advances in algorithmic, detailed-balance Lindbladians enable the efficient simulation of open-system dynamics converging towards desired target states. However, the overall complexity of such schemes is governed by system-size dependent mixing times. In this work, we analyse algorithmic Lindbladians for Gibbs state preparation and prove that they exhibit rapid mixing, i.e., convergence in time poly-logarithmic in the system size. We first establish this for non-interacting spin systems, free fermions, and free bosons, and then show that these rapid mixing results are stable under perturbations, covering weakly interacting qudits and perturbed non-hopping fermions. Our results constitute the first efficient mixing bounds for non-commuting qudit models and bosonic systems at arbitrary temperatures. Compared to prior spectral-gap-based results for fermions, we achieve exponentially faster mixing, further featuring explicit constants on the maximal allowed interaction strength. This not only improves the overall polynomial runtime for quantum Gibbs state preparation, but also enhances robustness against noise. Our analysis relies on oscillator norm techniques from mathematical physics, where we introduce tailored variants adapted to specific Lindbladians $\unicode{x2014}$ an innovation that we expect to significantly broaden the scope of these methods."
2510.04946,Leveraging Analog Neutral Atom Quantum Computers for Diversified Pricing   in Hybrid Column Generation Frameworks,2025-10-06T15:47:21Z,"In this work, we develop new pulse designs and embedding strategies to improve the analog quantum subroutines of hybrid column generation (CG) algorithms based on neutral-atoms quantum computers (NAQCs). These strategies are designed to improve the quality and diversity of the samples generated. We apply these to an important combinatorial optimization (CO) problem in logistics, namely the fleet assignment. Depending on the instance tested, our quantum protocol has a performance that is either comparable or worse than the best classical method tested, both in terms of the number of iterations and final objective value. We identify the cause of these suboptimal solutions as a result of our quantum protocol often generating high-quality but degenerate samples. We address this limitation by introducing a greedy post-processing technique, Make\_Diff, which applies bit-wise modifications to degenerate samples in order to return a non-degenerate set. With this modification, our quantum protocol becomes competitive with an exact solver for the subproblem, all the while being resilient to state preparation and measurements (SPAM) errors. We also compare our CG scheme with a Gurobi solver and find that it performs better on over 50\% of our synthetic instances and that, despite Gurobi having a more extensive runtime. These improvements and benchmarks herald the potential of deploying hybrid CG schemes on NISQ devices for industrially relevant CO problems."
2510.04943,The NPA hierarchy does not always attain the commuting operator value,2025-10-06T15:46:44Z,"We show that it is undecidable to determine whether the commuting operator value of a nonlocal game is strictly greater than 1/2. As a corollary, there is a boolean constraint system (BCS) game for which the value of the Navascu\'es-Pironio-Ac\'in (NPA) hierarchy does not attain the commuting operator value at any finite level. Our contribution involves establishing a computable mapping from Turing machines to BCS nonlocal games in which the halting property of the machine is encoded as a decision problem for the commuting operator value of the game. Our techniques are algebraic and distinct from those used to establish MIP*=RE."
2510.04931,Visualising Quantum Entanglement Using Interactive Electronic Quantum   Dice,2025-10-06T15:40:55Z,"Quantum entanglement remains a challenging concept to teach and visualise due to its microscopic and non-classical nature. We present innovative educational demonstration material consisting of electronic dice that simulate the properties of quantum entanglement through haptic interaction. The system uses displays, orientation sensors, and wireless communication to visualise key quantum mechanical principles such as superposition, measurement, and entanglement correlations. This analogy enables students to experience quantum phenomena through familiar objects, making abstract concepts more tangible. The dice support various educational scenarios, from basic entanglement demonstrations to more complex quantum key distribution experiments, and can be adapted for different educational levels from secondary school to undergraduate physics courses. Initial implementations demonstrate that the interactive nature of the Quantum Dice can help users develop an intuitive understanding of quantum mechanical principles. The low-cost, open source, and robust design makes Quantum Dice accessible to a wider range of educational institutions."
2510.04929,Efficient Quantum Hermite Transform,2025-10-06T15:40:03Z,"We present a new primitive for quantum algorithms that implements a discrete Hermite transform efficiently, in time that depends logarithmically in both the dimension and the inverse of the allowable error. This transform, which maps basis states to states whose amplitudes are proportional to the Hermite functions, can be interpreted as the Gaussian analogue of the Fourier transform. Our algorithm is based on a method to exponentially fast forward the evolution of the quantum harmonic oscillator, which significantly improves over prior art. We apply this Hermite transform to give examples of provable quantum query advantage in property testing and learning. In particular, we show how to efficiently test the property of being close to a low- degree in the Hermite basis when inputs are sampled from the Gaussian distribution, and how to solve a Gaussian analogue of the Goldreich-Levin learning task efficiently. We also comment on other potential uses of this transform to simulating time dynamics of quantum systems in the continuum."
2510.04921,Improved Clifford operations in constant commutative depth,2025-10-06T15:33:53Z,"The commutative depth model allows gates that commute with each other to be performed in parallel. We show how to compute Clifford operations in constant commutative depth more efficiently than was previously known. Bravyi, Maslov, and Nam [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129:230501, 2022] showed that every element of the Clifford group (on $n$ qubits) can be computed in commutative depth 23 and size $O(n^2)$. We show that the Prefix Sum problem can be computed in commutative depth 16 and size $O(n \log n)$, improving on the previous depth 18 and size $O(n^2)$ bounds. We also show that, for arbitrary Cliffords, the commutative depth bound can be reduced to 16. Finally, we show some lower bounds: that there exist Cliffords whose commutative depth is at least 4; and that there exist Cliffords for which any constant commutative depth circuit has size $\Omega(n^2)$."
2510.04907,Variational optimization of projected entangled-pair states on the   triangular lattice,2025-10-06T15:21:01Z,"We introduce a general corner transfer matrix renormalization group algorithm tailored to projected entangled-pair states on the triangular lattice. By integrating automatic differentiation, our approach enables direct variational energy minimization on this lattice geometry. In contrast to conventional approaches that map the triangular lattice onto a square lattice with diagonal next-nearest-neighbour interactions, our native formulation yields improved variational results at the same bond dimension. This improvement stems from a more faithful and physically informed representation of the entanglement structure in the tensor network and an increased number of variational parameters. We apply our method to the antiferromagnetic nearest-neighbour Heisenberg model on the triangular and kagome lattice, and benchmark our results against previous numerical studies."
2510.04880,Do Qubit States have to be non-degenerate two-level systems?,2025-10-06T15:01:43Z,"A qubit, or quantum bit, is conventionally defined as ""a physical system for storing information that is capable of existing in either of two quantum states or in a superposition of both"". In this paper, we examine the simple question of whether two distinct levels, each consisting of multiply degenerate sub-states, could serve as a practical quantum bit. We explore this idea using a well-characterized atomic system of the kind employed in several quantum computing implementations. We approximate the atom as a two-level system without degeneracy lifting in the magnetic quantum number while using the angular momentum addition rules to select the desired state transition. We find that, in the continuous presence of the field, the atom still undergoes Rabi oscillations, which are suitable for quantum gate construction. In addition, we compute the average fidelity in quantum gate performance for a single degenerate atom and postulate the required form of two-atom interaction to construct a controlled Z gate."
2510.04877,The tetrahedral Horn problem and asymptotics of U(n) 6j symbols,2025-10-06T15:00:25Z,"Horn's problem is concerned with characterizing the eigenvalues $(a,b,c)$ of Hermitian matrices $(A,B,C)$ satisfying the constraint $A+B=C$ and forming the edges of a triangle in the space of Hermitian matrices. It has deep connections to tensor product invariants, Littlewood-Richardson coefficients, geometric invariant theory and the intersection theory of Schubert varieties. This paper concerns the tetrahedral Horn problem which aims to characterize the tuples of eigenvalues $(a,b,c,d,e,f)$ of Hermitian matrices $(A,B,C,D,E,F)$ forming the edges of a tetrahedron, and thus satisfying the constraints $A+B=C$, $B+D=F$, $D+C=E$ and $A+F=E$.   Here we derive new inequalities satisfied by the Schur-polynomials of such eigenvalues and, using eigenvalue estimation techniques from quantum information theory, prove their satisfaction up to degree $k$ implies the existence of approximate solutions with error $O(\ln k / k)$. Moreover, the existence of these tetrahedra is related to the semiclassical asymptotics of the $6j$-symbols for the unitary group $U(n)$, which are maps between multiplicity spaces that encode the associativity relation for tensor products of irreducible representations. Using our techniques, we prove the asymptotics of norms of these $6j$-symbols are either inverse-polynomial or exponential depending on whether there exists such tetrahedra of Hermitian matrices."
2510.04874,A new application of the Fox-Wright functions: the coherent states   formalism,2025-10-06T15:00:10Z,"In this paper we extend the applicability of Fox-Wright functions beyond mathematics, specifically in quantum physics. We focused our attention on a new application, on the connection between the Fox-Wright functions and the generalized coherent states formalism. We constructed the generalized coherent states in the Barut-Girardello manner, in which the Fox-Wright functions play the role of normalization functions, and we demonstrated that the Fox-Wright coherent states satisfy all general conditions imposed on the set of coherent states. In parallel, we examined the properties of both pure and mixed (thermal) Fox-Wright coherent states. All calculations were performed within the diagonal operators ordering technique (DOOT) using the Dirac's bra-ket formalism. Finally, we introduced some (specifically, integral) feedback elements that Fox-Wright coherent states induce in the theory of special functions, including a new integral representation of Fox-Wright functions."
2510.04866,Information-thermodynamic bounds on precision in interacting quantum   systems,2025-10-06T14:51:47Z,"The thermodynamic uncertainty relation quantifies a trade-off between the relative fluctuations of trajectory currents and the thermodynamic cost, indicating that the current precision is fundamentally constrained by entropy production. In classical bipartite systems, it has been shown that information flow between subsystems can enhance the current precision alongside thermodynamic dissipation. In this study, we investigate how information flow, local dissipation, and quantum effects jointly constrain current fluctuations within a subsystem of interacting quantum systems. Unlike classical bipartite systems, quantum subsystems can exhibit simultaneous state changes and maintain quantum coherence, which fundamentally alters the precision-dissipation trade-off. For this general setting, we derive a quantum thermokinetic uncertainty relation for interacting multipartite systems, establishing a thermodynamic trade-off between current fluctuations, information flow, local dissipation, and quantum effects. Our analysis shows that, in addition to local dissipation, both information exchange and quantum coherence play essential roles in suppressing current fluctuations. These results have important implications for the performance of quantum thermal machines, such as information-thermodynamic engines and quantum clocks. We validate our theoretical findings through numerical simulations on two representative models: an autonomous quantum Maxwell's demon and a quantum clock. These results extend uncertainty relations to multipartite open quantum systems and elucidate the functional role of information flow in fluctuation suppression."
2510.04818,Super-resolution of partially coherent bosonic sources,2025-10-06T14:00:15Z,"We consider the problem of imaging two partially coherent sources and derive the ultimate quantum limits for estimating all relevant parameters, namely their separation, relative intensity, as well as their coherence factor. We show that the separation of the two sources can be super-resolved over the entire range of all other pertinent parameters (with the exception of fully coherent sources), with anti-correlated sources furnishing the largest possible gain in estimation precision, using a binary spatial mode demultiplexing measurement positioned at the center of intensity of the joint point spread function for the two sources. In the sub-Rayleigh limit, we show that both the relative intensity, as well as the real part of the coherence factor, can be optimally estimated by a simple boson counting measurement, making it possible to optimally estimate the separation, relative intensity and real coherence factor of the sources simultaneously. Within the same limit, we show that the imaging problem can be effectively reduced to one where all relevant parameters are encoded in the Bloch vector of a two-dimensional system. Using such a model we find that indirect estimation schemes, which attempt to extract estimates of the separation of the two sources by measuring the purity of the corresponding state of the two-level system, yield suboptimal estimation precision for all non-zero values of the coherence factor."
2510.04788,Far-from-equilibrium thermodynamics of non-Abelian thermal states,2025-10-06T13:10:37Z,"Noncommutativity of observables is a central feature of quantum physics. It plays a fundamental role in the formulation of the uncertainty principle for complementary variables and strongly affects the laws of thermodynamics for systems with noncommuting, that is, non-Abelian, conserved quantities. We here derive nonequilibrium generalizations of the second law of thermodynamics in the form of fluctuation relations, both for mechanically and thermally driven quantum systems. We identify a non-Abelian contribution to the energy and entropy balances, without which these relations would be violated. The latter term can be controlled to enhance both work extraction and nonequilibrium currents compared to what is obtained in commuting thermodynamics. These findings demonstrate that noncommutativity maybe a useful thermodynamic resource."
2510.04766,Counterdiabatic driving at Rydberg excitation for symmetric $C_Z$ gates   with ultracold neutral atoms,2025-10-06T12:40:23Z,"We extend the scheme of neutral atom Rydberg $C_Z$ gate based on double sequence of adiabatic pulses applied symmetrically to both atoms using counterdiabatic driving in the regime of Rydberg blockade. This provides substantial reducing of quantum gate operation times (at least five times) compared to previously proposed adiabatic schemes, which is important for high-fidelity entanglement due to finite Rydberg lifetimes. We analyzed schemes of adiabatic rapid passage with counterdiabatic driving for single-photon, two-photon and three-photon schemes of Rydberg excitation for rubidium and cesium atoms. We designed laser pulse profiles with fully analytical shapes and calculated the Bell fidelity taking into account atomic lifetimes and finite blockade strengths. We show that the upper limit of the Bell fidelity reaches ${\mathcal F}\simeq0.9999$ in a room-temperature environment."
2510.04756,Finite temperature dopant-induced spin reorganization explored via   tensor networks in the two-dimensional $t$-$J$ model,2025-10-06T12:34:05Z,"Doped Mott insulators host intertwined spin-charge phenomena that evolve with temperature and can culminate in stripe order or superconductivity at low temperatures. The two-dimensional $t$-$J$ model captures this interplay yet finite-temperature, infinite-size calculations remain difficult. Using purification represented by a tensor network - an infinite projected entangled-pair state (iPEPS) ansatz - we simulate the $t$-$J$ model at finite temperature directly in the thermodynamic limit, reaching temperatures down to one tenth of the hopping rate and hole concentrations up to one quarter of the lattice sites. Beyond specific heat, uniform susceptibility, and compressibility, we introduce dopant-conditioned multi-point correlators that map how holes reshape local exchange. Nearest-neighbor hole pairs produce a strong cooperative response that reinforces antiferromagnetism on the adjacent parallel bonds, and single holes weaken nearby antiferromagnetic bonds; d-wave pairing correlations remain short-ranged over the same window. These results provide experiment-compatible thermodynamic-limit benchmarks and establish dopant-conditioned correlators as incisive probes of short-range spin-texture reorganization at finite temperature."
2510.04754,Collusion-Resistant Quantum Secure Key Leasing Beyond Decryption,2025-10-06T12:31:39Z,"Secure key leasing (SKL) enables the holder of a secret key for a cryptographic function to temporarily lease the key using quantum information. Later, the recipient can produce a deletion certificate, which proves that they no longer have access to the secret key. The security guarantee ensures that even a malicious recipient cannot continue to evaluate the function, after producing a valid deletion certificate.   Most prior work considers an adversarial recipient that obtains a single leased key, which is insufficient for many applications. In the more realistic collusion-resistant setting, security must hold even when polynomially many keys are leased (and subsequently deleted). However, achieving collusion-resistant SKL from standard assumptions remains poorly understood, especially for functionalities beyond decryption.   We improve upon this situation by introducing new pathways for constructing collusion-resistant SKL. Our main contributions are as follows:   - A generalization of quantum-secure collusion-resistant traitor tracing called multi-level traitor tracing (MLTT), and a compiler that transforms an MLTT scheme for a primitive X into a collusion-resistant SKL scheme for primitive X.   - The first bounded collusion-resistant SKL scheme for PRFs, assuming LWE.   - A compiler that upgrades any single-key secure SKL scheme for digital signatures into one with unbounded collusion-resistance, assuming OWFs.   - A compiler that upgrades collusion-resistant SKL schemes with classical certificates to ones having verification-query resilience, assuming OWFs."
2510.04747,Quantum Reservoir Computing for Credit Card Default Prediction on a   Neutral Atom Platform,2025-10-06T12:27:08Z,"In this paper, we define and benchmark a hybrid quantum-classical machine learning pipeline by performing a binary classification task applied to a real-world financial use case. Specifically, we implement a Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC) layer within a classical routine that includes data preprocessing and binary classification. The reservoir layer has been executed on QuEra's Aquila, a 256-qubit neutral atom simulator, using two different types of encoding: position and local detuning. In the former case, classical data are encoded into the relative distance between atoms; in the latter, into pulse amplitudes. The developed pipeline is applied to predict credit card defaults using a public dataset and a wide variety of traditional classifiers. The results are compared with a fully-classical pipeline including a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model. Additionally, the impact of hardware noise on classification performance is evaluated by comparing the results obtained using Aquila within the classification workflow with those obtained using a classical, noiseless emulation of the quantum system. The results indicate that the noiseless emulation achieves competitive performance with the fully-classical pipeline, while noise significantly degrades overall performance. Although the results for this specific use case are comparable to those of the classical benchmark, the flexibility and scalability of QRC highlight strong potential for a wide range of applications."
2510.04736,Quantum Subgradient Estimation for Conditional Value-at-Risk   Optimization,2025-10-06T12:09:43Z,"Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) is a leading tail-risk measure in finance, central to both regulatory and portfolio optimization frameworks. Classical estimation of CVaR and its gradients relies on Monte Carlo simulation, incurring $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ sample complexity to achieve $\epsilon$-accuracy. In this work, we design and analyze a quantum subgradient oracle for CVaR minimization based on amplitude estimation. Via a tripartite proposition, we show that CVaR subgradients can be estimated with $O(1/\epsilon)$ quantum queries, even when the Value-at-Risk (VaR) threshold itself must be estimated. We further quantify the propagation of estimation error from the VaR stage to CVaR gradients and derive convergence rates of stochastic projected subgradient descent using this oracle. Our analysis establishes a near-quadratic improvement in query complexity over classical Monte Carlo. Numerical experiments with simulated quantum circuits confirm the theoretical rates and illustrate robustness to threshold estimation noise. This constitutes the first rigorous complexity analysis of quantum subgradient methods for tail-risk minimization."
2510.04732,Enhancing Optomechanical Entanglement and Mechanical Squeezing by the   Synergistic Effect of Quadratic Optomechanical Coupling and Coherent Feedback,2025-10-06T12:01:30Z,"Quantum entanglement and squeezing associated with the motions of massive mechanical oscillators play an essential role in both fundamental science and emerging quantum technologies, yet realizing such macroscopic nonclassical states remains a formidable challenge. In this paper, we investigate how to achieve strong optomechanical entanglement and mechanical squeezing in a membrane-embedded cavity optomechanical system incorporating a coherent feedback loop, where the membrane interacts with the cavity mode through both linear and quadratic optomechanical couplings. This hybrid optomechanical architecture offers a flexible tunability of intrinsic system parameters, thus allowing the membrane to be stiffened or softened through tuning the sign of quadratic optomechanical coupling and the cavity decay rate to be reduced via feedback control. Exploiting these unique features, we demonstrate that optomechanical entanglement can be substantially enhanced with positive coupling sign and suitable feedback parameters, while strong mechanical squeezing beyond the 3dB limit is simultaneously achieved over a broad parameter range with negative coupling sign, reaching squeezing degree above 10dB under optimized conditions. Our proposal, establishing an all-optical method for generating highly entangled or squeezed states in cavity optomechanical systems, opens up a new route to explore macroscopic quantum effects and to advance quantum information processing."
2510.04719,A Lie Theoretic Framework for Controlling Open Quantum Systems,2025-10-06T11:38:02Z,"This thesis focuses on the Lie-theoretic foundations of controlled open quantum systems. We describe Markovian open quantum system evolutions by Lie semigroups, whose corresponding infinitesimal generators lie in a special type of convex cone - a Lie wedge. The Lie wedge associated to a given control system therefore consists of all generators of the quantum dynamical semigroup that are physically realisable as a result of the interplay between the coherent and incoherent processes the quantum system is subject to. For $n$-qubit open quantum systems, we provide a parametrisation of the largest physically relevant Lie algebra (the system algebra), in which these Lie wedges are contained: the Lindblad-Kossakowski Lie algebra. This parametrisation provides several useful benefits. First, it allows us to construct explicit forms of these system Lie wedges and their respective system Lie algebras. Second, we analyse which control scenarios yield Lie wedges that are closed under Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) multiplication and therefore generate Markovian semigroups of time-independent quantum channels. Lie wedges of this form are called Lie semialgebras, and we completely solve this open problem by proving that Lie wedges specialise to this form only when the coherent controls have no effect on both the inherent drift Hamiltonian and the incoherent part of the dynamics. Finally, this parametrisation of the Lindblad-Kossakowski Lie algebra points to an intuitive separation between unital and non-unital dissipative dynamics, where the non-unital component of the dynamics is described by affine translation operations. These translation operators are then exploited to construct purely dissipative fixed-point engineering schemes to obtain either pure or mixed states as a system's unique fixed point."
2510.04716,Curved Boolean Logic: A Contextual Generalization of Propositional Logic   with Algorithmic Consequences,2025-10-06T11:34:08Z,"Curved Boolean Logic (CBL) generalizes propositional logic by allowing local truth assignments that do not extend to a single global valuation, analogous to curvature in geometry. We give equivalent sheaf and exclusivity-graph semantics and a context-aware proof calculus that is conservative in the flat limit. We formalize CBL-SAT and basic complexity (NP-complete in general) and present operational operators (CBL-AC and CBL-CONS) that prune contradictions earlier on classical hardware. We model noise with iid, AR(1)-correlated, and adversarial bounded perturbations and provide permutation-based significance with Benjamini-Hochberg FDR control. A Colab-ready notebook (ancillary files) regenerates all figures and statistics. We position CBL relative to KCBS, CSW, and sheaf frameworks and outline links to SAT/CSP and robustness/adapter stability in large language models."

The joint concavity/convexity of the trace functions $\mathrm{Tr}\,\mathcal{M}_{\alpha,p}$ is also discussed based on theory of quantum divergences."
2510.04632,The PPP model - a minimal viable parametrisation of conjugated chemistry   for modern computing applications,2025-10-06T09:36:52Z,"The semi-empirical Pariser-Parr-Pople (PPP) Hamiltonian is reviewed for its ability to provide a minimal model of the chemistry of conjugated $\pi$-electron systems, and its current applications and limitations are discussed. From its inception, the PPP Hamiltonian has helped in the development of new computational approaches in instances where compute is constrained due to its inherent approximations that allow for an efficient representation and calculation of many systems of chemical and technological interest. The crucial influence of electron correlation on the validity of these approximations is discussed, and we review how PPP model exact calculations have enabled a deeper understanding of conjugated polymer systems. More recent usage of the PPP Hamiltonian includes its application in high-throughput screening activities to the inverse design problem, which we illustrate here for two specific fields of technological interest: singlet fission and singlet-triplet inverted energy gap molecules. Finally, we conjecture how utilizing the PPP model in quantum computing applications could be mutually beneficial."
2510.04598,Novel frame changes for quantum physics,2025-10-06T09:00:16Z,"We present novel, exotic types of frame changes for the calculation of quantum evolution operators. We detail in particular the biframe, in which a physical system's evolution is seen in an equal mixture of two different standard frames at once. We prove that, in the biframe, convergence of all series expansions of the solution is quadratically faster than in `conventional' frames. That is, if in laboratory frame or after a standard frame change the error at order $n$ of some perturbative series expansion of the evolution operator is on the order of $\epsilon^n$, $0<\epsilon<1$, for a computational cost $C(n)$ then it is on the order of $\epsilon^{2n+1}$ in the biframe for the same computational cost. We demonstrate that biframe is one of an infinite family of novel frames, some of which lead to higher accelerations but require more computations to set up initially, leading to a trade-off between acceleration and computational burden."
2510.04596,Generalized Entanglement of Purification Criteria for 2-Producible   States in Multipartite Systems,2025-10-06T08:52:18Z,"Multipartite entanglement has much more complex structures than bipartite entanglement, such as the semiseparable state. The multipartite state absent of multipartite entanglement is called a 2-producible state, which is a tensor product of at most 2-partite states. Recently, it is proved that a tripartite pure state is 2-producible if and only if the gap between entanglement of purification and its lower bound vanishes. Here, we show that the entanglement of purification gap is not sufficient to detect more than tripartite entanglement with 4-partite random stabilizer states. We then generalize entanglement of purification to the multipartite case, where the gap between generalized entanglement of purification and its lower bound quantifies the quantum communication cost for distributing one part of the multipartite system to the other parts. We also demonstrate that a multipartite state is 2-producible if and only if the generalized entanglement of purification gaps vanish. In addition, we show that the generalized entanglement of purification gaps are related to the local recoverability of the multipartite state from its marginal state on some parts of the system and the distance between the state and the 2-producible states with the relative entropy. Moreover, we calculate the generalized entanglement of purification gaps for the states fulfilling the generalized Schmidt decomposition, which implies that the 4-partite stabilizer states do not always have the generalized Schmidt decomposition. Our results provide a quantitive characterization of multipartite entanglement in multipartite system, which will promote further investigations and understanding of multipartite entanglement."
2510.04594,Embedding-Aware Noise Modeling of Quantum Annealing,2025-10-06T08:48:25Z,"Quantum annealing provides a practical realization of adiabatic quantum computation and has emerged as a promising approach for solving large-scale combinatorial optimization problems. However, current devices remain constrained by sparse hardware connectivity, which requires embedding logical variables into chains of physical qubits. This embedding overhead limits scalability and reduces reliability as longer chains are more prone to noise-induced errors. In this work, building on the known structural result that the average chain length in clique embeddings grows linearly with the problem size, we develop a mathematical framework that connects embedding-induced overhead with hardware noise in D-Wave's Zephyr topology. Our analysis derives closed-form expressions for chain break probability and chain break fraction under a Gaussian control error model, establishing how noise scales with embedding size and how chain strength should be adjusted with chain length to maintain reliability. Experimental results from the Zephyr topology-based quantum processing unit confirm the accuracy of these predictions, demonstrating both the validity of the theoretical noise model and the practical relevance of the derived scaling rule. Beyond validating a theoretical model against hardware data, our findings establish a general embedding-aware noise framework that explains the trade-off between chain stability and logical coupler fidelity. Our framework advances the understanding of noise amplification in current devices and provides quantitative guidance for embedding-aware parameter tuning strategies."
2510.04571,Double-pair Coulomb(-Breit) photon correction to the correlated   relativistic energy,2025-10-06T08:12:38Z,"The simplest, algebraic quantum-electrodynamical corrections, due to the double-negative energy subspace and instantaneous interactions, are computed to the no-pair Dirac-Coulomb(-Breit) energy of two-spin-1/2-fermion systems. Numerical results are reported for two-electron atoms with a clamped nucleus and positronium-like genuine two-particle systems. The Bethe-Salpeter equation provides the theoretical framework, and numerical methods have been developed for its equal-time time-slice. In practice, it requires solving a sixteen-component eigenvalue equation with a two-particle Dirac Hamiltonian, including the appropriate interaction. The double-pair corrections can either be included in the interaction part of the eigenvalue equation or treated as a perturbation to the no-pair Hamiltonian. The numerical results have an $\alpha$ fine-structure constant dependence that is in excellent agreement with the known $\alpha^3E_\mathrm{h}\$-order double-pair correction of non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics."
2510.04561,Expander qLDPC Codes against Long-range Correlated Errors in Memory,2025-10-06T07:51:09Z,"Fault-tolerance using constant space-overhead against long-range correlated errors is an important practical question. In the pioneering works [Terhal and Burkard, PRA 2005], [Aliferis et al, PRA 2005], [Aharonov et al, PRL 2006], fault-tolerance using poly-logarithmic overhead against long-range correlation modeled by pairwise joint Hamiltonian was proven when the total correlation of an error at a qubit location with errors at other locations was $O(1)$, i.e., the total correlation at a location did not scale with the number of qubits. This condition, under spatial symmetry, can simply be stated as the correlation between locations decaying faster than $\frac{1}{\text{dist}^{\text{dim}}}$. However, the pairwise Hamiltonian model remained intractable for constant overhead codes. Recently, [Bagewadi and Chatterjee, PRA 2025] introduced and analyzed the generalized hidden Markov random field (MRF) model, which provably captures all stationary distributions, including long-range correlations [Kunsch et al, Ann. App. Prob. 1995]. It resulted in a noise threshold in the case of long-range correlation, for memory corrected by the linear-distance Tanner codes [Leverrier and Zemor, FOCS 2022] for super-polynomial time. In this paper, we prove a similar result for square-root distance qLDPC codes and provide an explicit expression for the noise threshold in terms of the code rate, for up to $o(\sqrt{\text{\#qubits}})$ scaling of the total correlation of error at a location with errors at other locations."
2510.04552,Quantum Reverse Shannon Theorem Simplified,2025-10-06T07:34:20Z,"We revisit the quantum reverse Shannon theorem, a central result in quantum information theory that characterizes the resources needed to simulate quantum channels when entanglement is freely available. We derive a universal additive upper bound on the smoothed max-information in terms of the sandwiched R\'enyi mutual information. This bound yields tighter single-shot results, eliminates the need for the post-selection technique, and leads to a conceptually simpler proof of the quantum reverse Shannon theorem. By consolidating and streamlining earlier approaches, our result provides a clearer and more direct understanding of the resource costs of simulating quantum channels."
2510.04545,Efficient three-qubit gates with giant atoms,2025-10-06T07:22:16Z,"Three-qubit gates are highly beneficial operations in quantum computing, enabling compact implementations of quantum algorithms and efficient generation of multipartite entangled states. However, realizing such gates with high fidelity remains challenging due to crosstalk, complex control requirements, and the overhead of parametric or tunable couplers. In this work, we propose and analyze the implementation of fast, high-fidelity three-qubit gates using giant atoms--artificial atoms coupled to a waveguide at multiple spatially separated points. By leveraging interference effects intrinsic to the giant-atom architecture, we demonstrate that native three-qubit gates, such as the controlled-CZ-SWAP (CCZS) and the dual-iSWAP (DIV), can be realized through simple frequency tuning, without the need for complex pulse shaping or additional hardware. We evaluate gate performance under realistic decoherence and show that fidelities exceeding 99.5% are achievable with current experimental parameters in superconducting circuits. As an application, we present a scalable protocol for preparing three- and five-qubit GHZ states using minimal gate depth, achieving high state fidelity within sub-300ns timescales. Our results position giant-atom systems as a promising platform for entangled-state preparation and low-depth quantum circuit design in near-term quantum computers and quantum simulators."
2510.04534,Integrated photonic platform with high-speed entanglement generation and   witnessing,2025-10-06T06:55:56Z,"High-speed generation and efficient entanglement detection on a photonic chip are essential for quantum information applications but hard to achieve due to common photonic chips' material properties and limited component performance. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate entanglement witness on a silicon photonic chip, with multi-rail single-photon entanglement generation based on decoy-state techniques. The detection is based on balanced homodyne detectors on the same photonic chip with a bandwidth of up to 12.5 GHz, which allows room-temperature operation. A loss-equivalent analysis method compensates for optical losses and system noises. Experimental results quantify an entangled state fidelity of 92% in quantum state tomography and a Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) violation lower bound of 2.59. These results establish a viable path toward fully integrated, high-bandwidth, room-temperature quantum photonic systems, with potential applications in on-chip quantum optics and quantum random number generation."
2510.04529,Computational Certified Deletion Property of Magic Square Game and its   Application to Classical Secure Key Leasing,2025-10-06T06:47:37Z,"We present the first construction of a computational Certified Deletion Property (CDP) achievable with classical communication, derived from the compilation of the non-local Magic Square Game (MSG). We leverage the KLVY compiler to transform the non-local MSG into a 2-round interactive protocol, rigorously demonstrating that this compilation preserves the game-specific CDP. Previously, the quantum value and rigidity of the compiled game were investigated. We emphasize that we are the first to investigate CDP (local randomness in [Fu and Miller, Phys. Rev. A 97, 032324 (2018)]) for the compiled game. Then, we combine this CDP with the framework [Kitagawa, Morimae, and Yamakawa, Eurocrypt 2025] to construct Secure Key Leasing with classical Lessor (cSKL). SKL enables the Lessor to lease the secret key to the Lessee and verify that a quantum Lessee has indeed deleted the key. In this paper, we realize cSKL for PKE, PRF, and digital signature. Compared to prior works for cSKL, we realize cSKL for PRF and digital signature for the first time. In addition, we succeed in weakening the assumption needed to construct cSKL."
2510.04527,Quantum capacity amplification via privacy,2025-10-06T06:35:19Z,"We investigate superadditivity of quantum capacity through private channels whose Choi-Jamiolkowski operators are private states. This perspective links the security structure of private states to quantum capacity and clarifies the role of the shield system: information encoded in the shield system that would otherwise leak to the environment can be recycled when paired with an assisting channel, thereby boosting capacity. Our main contributions are threefold: Firstly, we develop a general framework that provides a sufficient condition for capacity amplification, which is formulated in terms of the assisting channel's Holevo information. As examples, we give explicit, dimension and parameter dependent amplification thresholds for erasure and depolarizing channels. Secondly, assuming the Spin alignment conjecture, we derive a single-letter expression for the quantum capacity of a family of private channels that are neither degradable, anti-degradable, nor PPT; as an application, we construct channels with vanishing quantum capacity yet unbounded private capacity. Thirdly, we further analyze approximate private channels: we give an alternative proof of superactivation that extends its validity to a broader parameter regime, and, by combining amplification bounds with continuity estimates, we establish a metric separation showing that channels exhibiting capacity amplification have nonzero diamond distance from the set of anti-degradable channels, indicating that existing approximate (anti-)degradability bounds are not tight. We also revisit the computability of the regularized quantum capacity and modestly suggest that this fundamental question still remains open."
2510.04526,Subsystem many-hypercube codes: High-rate concatenated codes with   low-weight syndrome measurements,2025-10-06T06:34:00Z,"Quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs) require high encoding rate in addition to high threshold unless a sufficiently large number of physical qubits are available. The many-hypercube (MHC) codes defined as the concatenation of the [[6,4,2]] quantum error-detecting code have been proposed as high-performance and high-encoding-rate QECCs. However, the concatenated codes have a disadvantage that the syndrome weight grows exponentially with respect to the concatenation level. To address this issue, here we propose subsystem quantum codes based on the MHC codes. In particular, we study the smallest subsystem MHC codes, namely, subsystem codes derived from the concatenated [[4,2,2]] error-detecting codes. The resulting codes have a constant syndrome-measurement weight of 4, while keeping high encoding rates. We develop the block-MAP and neural-network decoders and show that they demonstrate superior performance to the bounded-distance decoder."
2510.04521,Fast surgery for quantum LDPC codes,2025-10-06T06:29:16Z,"Quantum LDPC codes promise significant reductions in physical qubit overhead compared with topological codes. However, many existing constructions for performing logical operations come with distance-dependent temporal overheads. We introduce a scheme for performing generalized surgery on quantum LDPC codes using a constant number of rounds of syndrome measurement. The merged code in our scheme is constructed by taking the total complex of the base code and a suitably chosen homomorphic chain complex. We demonstrate the applicability of our scheme on an example multi-cycle code and assess the performance under a phenomenological noise model, showing that fast surgery performs comparably to standard generalized surgery with multiple rounds. Our results pave the way towards fault-tolerant quantum computing with LDPC codes with both low spatial and temporal overheads."
2510.04518,Continuum Model of Isospectrally Patterned Lattices,2025-10-06T06:18:04Z,Isospectrally patterned lattices (IPL) have recently been shown to exhibit a rich band structure comprising both regimes of localized as well as extended states. The localized states show a single center localization behaviour with a characteristic localization length. We derive a continuum analogue of the IPL which allows us to determine analytically its eigenvalue spectrum and eigenstates thereby obtaining an expression for the localization length which involves the ratio of the coupling among the cells of the lattice and the phase gradient across the lattice. This continuum model breaks chiral symmetry but still shows a pairing of partner states with positive and negative energies except for the ground state. We perform a corresponding symmetry analysis which illuminates the continuum models structure as compared to a corresponding chirally symmetric Hamiltonian.
2510.04512,Quantum generative model on bicycle-sharing system and an application,2025-10-06T06:02:13Z,"Recently, bicycle-sharing systems have been implemented in numerous cities, becoming integral to daily life. However, a prevalent issue arises when intensive commuting demand leads to bicycle shortages in specific areas and at particular times. To address this challenge, we employ a novel quantum machine learning model that analyzes time series data by fitting quantum time evolution to observed sequences. This model enables us to capture actual trends in bicycle counts at individual ports and identify correlations between different ports. Utilizing the trained model, we simulate the impact of proactively adding bicycles to high-demand ports on the overall rental number across the system. Given that the core of this method lies in a Monte Carlo simulation, it is anticipated to have a wide range of industrial applications."

There are several different methods, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. In past years comparisons of these existing methods have been made, but new work has emerged since then. Therefore, we conducted a survey on quantum methods developed post-2020, applying two such solvers to the heat equation in one spatial dimension. By analyzing their performance (including the cost of classical extraction), we explore their precision and runtime efficiency advancements between the two, identifying advantages and considerations."
2510.04486,"Black-Box Separation Between Pseudorandom Unitaries, Pseudorandom   Isometries, and Pseudorandom Function-Like States",2025-10-06T04:50:37Z,"Pseudorandom functions (PRFs) are one of the most fundamental primitives in classical cryptography. On the other hand, in quantum cryptography, it is possible that PRFs do not exist but their quantum analogues could exist, and still enabling many applications including SKE, MACs, commitments, multiparty computations, and more. Pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) [Ji, Liu, Song, Crypto 2018], pseudorandom isometries (PRIs) [Ananth, Gulati, Kaleoglu, Lin, Eurocrypt 2024], and pseudorandom function-like state generators (PRFSGs) [Ananth, Qian, Yuen, Crypto 2022] are major quantum analogs of PRFs. PRUs imply PRIs, and PRIs imply PRFSGs, but the converse implications remain unknown. An important open question is whether these natural quantum analogues of PRFs are equivalent. In this paper, we partially resolve this question by ruling out black-box constructions of them:   1. There are no black-box constructions of $O(\log\lambda)$-ancilla PRUs from PRFSGs. 2. There are no black-box constructions of $O(\log\lambda)$-ancilla PRIs with $O(\log\lambda)$ stretch from PRFSGs. 3. There are no black-box constructions of $O(\log\lambda)$-ancilla PRIs with $O(\log\lambda)$ stretch from PRIs with $\Omega(\lambda)$ stretch.   Here, $O(\log\lambda)$-ancilla means that the generation algorithm uses at most $O(\log\lambda)$ ancilla qubits. PRIs with $s(\lambda)$ stretch is PRIs mapping $\lambda$ qubits to $\lambda+s(\lambda)$ qubits. To rule out the above black-box constructions, we construct a unitary oracle that separates them. For the separations, we construct an adversary based on the quantum singular value transformation, which would be independent of interest and should be useful for other oracle separations in quantum cryptography."
2510.04462,Robust iSWAP gates for semiconductor spin qubits with local driving,2025-10-06T03:25:00Z,"Scalable quantum computation demands high-fidelity two-qubit gates. However, decoherence and control errors are inevitable, which can decrease the quality of implemented quantum operations. We propose a robust iSWAP gate protocol for semiconductor spin qubits, which is a promising platform for scalable quantum computing. Our scheme uses only local microwave drives on conventional exchange-coupled spin qubits. This approach simultaneously addresses two critical challenges on semiconductor quantum computing: it suppresses low-frequency noise via continuous dynamical decoupling, and it circumvents the control difficulties associated with the ac modulation of the exchange interaction. We further develop a composite pulse sequence to remove drive-strength constraints and a dynamically corrected method to provide first-order immunity to microwave amplitude errors.Numerical simulations confirm that our scheme can achieve fidelity above the fault-tolerance threshold under current experimental conditions, offering a building block for practical quantum processors."
2510.04453,Lovász Meets Lieb-Schultz-Mattis: Complexity in Approximate Quantum   Error Correction,2025-10-06T03:00:43Z,"Approximate quantum error correction (AQEC) provides a versatile framework for both quantum information processing and probing many-body entanglement. We reveal a fundamental tension between the error-correcting power of an AQEC and the hardness of code state preparation. More precisely, through a novel application of the Lov\'asz local lemma, we establish a fundamental trade-off between local indistinguishability and circuit complexity, showing that orthogonal short-range entangled states must be distinguishable via a local operator. These results offer a powerful tool for exploring quantum circuit complexity across diverse settings. As applications, we derive stronger constraints on the complexity of AQEC codes with transversal logical gates and establish strong complexity lower bounds for W state preparation. Our framework also provides a novel perspective for systems with Lieb-Schultz-Mattis type constraints."
2510.04449,The average determinant of the reduced density matrices for each qubit   as a global entanglement measure,2025-10-06T02:47:38Z,"Meyer and Wallach proposed the average norm squared of the wedge products of the projections of a state onto the single qubit subspaces as the global entanglement measure. Meyer and Wallach's global entanglement has the significant impact. We propose the average determinant of reduced density matrices for each qubit as a global entanglement measure. We show that these two measures are the same algebraically though they use different concepts. By means of the properties of reduced density matrices, we can explore the present measure. We propose a decomposition law for the present measure, demonstrate that the present measure just measures the average mixedness for each qubit and the average 1-tangle, and indicate that for n-qubit W state, the average mixedness for each qubit and 1-tangle almost vanish for large number of qubits. We also point out that for two quits, the present measure is just the square of the concurrence while for three qubits, the present measure is or greater than 3-tangle."
2510.04448,Quantum Cryptography and Hardness of Non-Collapsing Measurements,2025-10-06T02:42:20Z,"One-way puzzles (OWPuzzs) introduced by Khurana and Tomer [STOC 2024] are a natural quantum analogue of one-way functions (OWFs), and one of the most fundamental primitives in ''Microcrypt'' where OWFs do not exist but quantum cryptography is possible. OWPuzzs are implied by almost all quantum cryptographic primitives, and imply several important applications such as non-interactive commitments and multi-party computations. A significant goal in the field of quantum cryptography is to base OWPuzzs on plausible assumptions that will not imply OWFs. In this paper, we base OWPuzzs on hardness of non-collapsing measurements. To that end, we introduce a new complexity class, $\mathbf{SampPDQP}$, which is a sampling version of the decision class $\mathbf{PDQP}$ introduced in [Aaronson, Bouland, Fitzsimons, and Lee, ITCS 2016]. We show that if $\mathbf{SampPDQP}$ is hard on average for quantum polynomial time, then OWPuzzs exist. $\mathbf{SampPDQP}$ is the class of sampling problems that can be solved by a classical polynomial-time algorithm that can make a single query to a non-collapsing measurement oracle, which is a ''magical'' oracle that can sample measurement results on quantum states without collapsing the states. Such non-collapsing measurements are highly unphysical operations that should be hard to realize in quantum polynomial-time. We also study upperbounds of the hardness of $\mathbf{SampPDQP}$. We introduce a new primitive, distributional collision-resistant puzzles (dCRPuzzs), which are a natural quantum analogue of distributional collision-resistant hashing [Dubrov and Ishai, STOC 2006]. We show that dCRPuzzs imply average-case hardness of $\mathbf{SampPDQP}$ (and therefore OWPuzzs as well). We also show that two-message honest-statistically-hiding commitments with classical communication and one-shot signatures [Amos, Georgiou, Kiayias, Zhandry, STOC 2020] imply dCRPuzzs."

To provide an accessible tool for such studies, we present FewBodyToolkit.jl, a Julia package for quantum few-body simulations. The package supports general two- and three-body systems in various spatial dimensions with arbitrary pair-interactions, and allows to calculate bound and resonant states.

This graph is defined by $n$ distinct elements, with vertices being all the \(\binom{n}{k}\) $k$-element subsets and two vertices are connected by an edge if they differ exactly by one element. However, most works in the literature focus solely on the search for a single target vertex on the Johnson graph. In this article, we utilize lackadaisical quantum walk--a form of discrete-time coined quantum walk with a wighted self-loop at each vertex of the graph--along with our recently proposed modified coin operator, $\mathcal{C}_g$, to find multiple target vertices on the Johnson graph $J(n,k)$ for various values of $k$. Additionally, a comparison based on the numerical analysis of the performance of the $\mathcal{C}_g$ coin operator in searching for multiple target vertices on the Johnson graph, against various other frequently used coin operators by the discrete-time quantum walk search algorithms, shows that only $\mathcal{C}_g$ coin can search for multiple target vertices with a very high success probability in all the scenarios discussed in this article, outperforming other widely used coin operators in the literature."

Recent advances in the discrete-time quantum walk search algorithm have enabled it to effectively handle multiple marked vertices, expanding its range of applications further. In this article, we propose a novel application of this advanced quantum walk search algorithm for the edge detection of images\textemdash a critical task in digital image processing. Given the probabilistic nature of quantum computing, obtaining measurement result with a high success probability is essential alongside faster computation time. Our quantum walk search algorithm demonstrates a high success probability in detecting the image edges compared to the existing quantum edge detection methods and outperforms classical edge detection methods with a quadratically faster speed. A small Qiskit circuit implementation of our method using a one-dimensional quantum walk search has been executed in Qiskit's $qasm\_simulator$ and $ibm\_sydney(fake)$ device."
2510.04411,Quantum precomputation: parallelizing cascade circuits and the   Moore-Nilsson conjecture is false,2025-10-06T00:56:53Z,"Parallelization is a major challenge in quantum algorithms due to physical constraints like no-cloning. This is vividly illustrated by the conjecture of Moore and Nilsson from their seminal work on quantum circuit complexity [MN01, announced 1998]: unitaries of a deceptively simple form--controlled-unitary ""staircases""--require circuits of minimum depth $\Omega(n)$. If true, this lower bound would represent a major break from classical parallelism and prove a quantum-native analogue of the famous NC $\neq$ P conjecture.   In this work we settle the Moore-Nilsson conjecture in the negative by compressing all circuits in the class to depth $O(\log n)$, which is the best possible. The parallelizations are exact, ancilla-free, and can be computed in poly($n$) time. We also consider circuits restricted to 2D connectivity, for which we derive compressions of optimal depth $O(\sqrt{n})$.   More generally, we make progress on the project of quantum parallelization by introducing a quantum blockwise precomputation technique somewhat analogous to the method of Arlazarov, Dini\v{c}, Kronrod, and Farad\v{z}ev [Arl+70] in classical dynamic programming, often called the ""Four-Russians method."" We apply this technique to more-general ""cascade"" circuits as well, obtaining for example polynomial depth reductions for staircases of controlled $\log(n)$-qubit unitaries."

Here, we develop tunable atomic routing protocols based on an integrable model of dipolar bosons confined in a four-well potential with a star-shaped configuration. By adjusting the system parameters, we identify a harmonic dynamical regime of the atomic population that can be treated analytically, providing a complete description of the system's behaviour for precise manipulation. We demonstrate three independent modes of control over the atomic population dynamics under the action of an external field: frequency tuning via variation in the field intensity, directional switching via spatial displacement of the field, and amplitude modulation by varying its duration. These modes operate under two distinct configurations: one source and two drains, and, in reverse order, two sources and one drain. These cases emulate an atomic 1:2 demultiplexer and 2:1 multiplexer, respectively. Our results may contribute to the development of control mechanisms in the design of quantum devices."
2510.04348,Electromagnetic instability of vacuum with instantons in the holographic   plasma,2025-10-05T20:16:51Z,"Using the gauge-gravity duality, we study the electromagnetic instability of vacuum with instantons in holographic plasma. The model we employ is the D(-1)-D3 brane system in which the D(-1)-branes correspond to the instantons in holography. To take into account the flavored quarks, the coincident probe D7-branes as flavors are embedded into the bulk geometry so that the effective electromagnetic Lagrangian with flavors corresponds to the action of the D7-branes according to gauge-gravity duality. We numerically evaluate the vacuum decay rate, the critical electric field and the V-A curve of the vacuum by using the D7-brane action with various values of the electromagnetic field. It implies the particles in the plasma acquire an effective mass in the presence of instantons as it is expected in the quantum field theory, and the plasma trends to become insulating when the electric field is small. This work reveals the relation between electromagnetic and instantonic properties of the vacuum in the plasma."
2510.04326,Integrable Floquet Time Crystals in One Dimension,2025-10-05T19:16:10Z,"We demonstrate the realization of a discrete-time crystal (DTC) phase in a family of periodically driven, one-dimensional quadratic lattice Hamiltonians that can be obtained using spin chains. These interactions preserve integrability while opening controllable gaps at resonant quasienergies and pinning the emergent quasienergy modes that are responsible for subharmonics. We demonstrate that the DTC phase is rigid in the parameter space of transverse field and an additional interaction like NNN coupling strength, with the drive frequency optimized to produce the strongest subharmonic response. We also provide a detailed phase portrait of the model, exhibiting a variety of new dynamical phases, such as a fragile time crystal and both spin-liquid and paramagnetic phases, as well as sharp quantum phase transitions between them. Finite-size scaling of the Floquet quasienergy splitting between the emergent subharmonic mode and its conjugate shows that the DTC lifetime diverges exponentially with system size. Our work thus establishes a novel mechanism for realizing robust, long-lived DTCs in one dimension, and paves the way for their experimental realization in near-term quantum simulators. Motivation for this work stems from the limitations of disorder-based stabilization schemes that rely on many-body localization and exhibit only prethermal or finite-lived plateaus, eventually restoring ergodicity. Disorder-free routes are therefore highly desirable. Integrable (or Floquet-integrable) systems provide an attractive alternative because their extensive set of conserved quantities and constrained scattering strongly restrict thermalization channels. Our construction exploits these integrable restrictions together with short-range NNN engineering to produce a clean, robust DTC that avoids the prethermal fragility of disordered realizations."

In the high parametric gain regime, several effects, including self- and cross-phase modulation as well as time-ordering corrections, become significant and can degrade source performance. In this work, we comprehensively investigate the generation of squeezed light from a silicon nitride resonator under pulsed pumping, spanning from low to high parametric gain up to 16 photons/pulse. We experimentally study how the average photon number and the first- and second- order correlations of the squeezed marginal modes evolve with increasing pulse energy, across various frequency detunings and pulse durations. Furthermore, we analyze the errors introduced by multi-pair emissions in estimating the joint temporal intensity via time-resolved coincidence measurements. We propose and demonstrate an error-correction strategy based on the marginal distributions of time-resolved multi-photon events. Our results provide a practical strategy for optimizing the gain and the temporal mode structure of pulsed squeezed light sources in microresonators, elucidating the physical mechanisms and limitations that govern source performance in the high gain regime."
2510.04294,Filtered Quantum Phase Estimation,2025-10-05T17:11:30Z,"Accurate state preparation is a critical bottleneck in many quantum algorithms, particularly those for ground state energy estimation. Even in fault-tolerant quantum computing, preparing a quantum state with sufficient overlap to the desired eigenstate remains a major challenge. To address this, we develop a unified framework for filtered-state preparation that enhances the overlap of a given input state through spectral filtering. This framework encompasses the polynomial and trigonometric realizations of filters, allowing a transparent analysis of the trade-offs between overlap amplification and preparation cost. As examples, we introduce signal-processing-inspired filters, such as Gaussian filters and Krylov subspace-based filters, that adaptively suppress excited-state contributions using low-rank projections. Within this framework, we further develop a filtered variant of QPE (FQPE) that mitigates the unfavorable dependence on the initial overlap present in standard QPE. Numerical experiments on Fermi-Hubbard models show that FQPE reduces the total runtime by more than two orders of magnitude in the high-precision regime, with overlap amplification exceeding a factor of one hundred."

Here, we theoretically investigate a variant of the Dicke model with higher-order discrete symmetry, resulting from complex-valued coupling coefficients between quantum emitters and a bosonic mode. We propose a driven-dissipative realization of this model focusing on optomechanical response of a driven atom tweezer array comprised of $n$ sub-ensembles and placed within an optical cavity, with the phase of the driving field advancing stepwise between sub-ensembles. Examining stationary points and their dynamical stability, we identify a phase diagram for $n\geq 3$ with three distinctive features: a $\mathbb{Z}_n$ ($\mathbb{Z}_{2n}$) symmetry-breaking superradiant phase for even (odd) $n$, a normal unbroken-symmetry phase that is dynamically unstable due to non-reciprocal forces between emitters, and a first-order phase transition separating these phases. This $n$-phase Dicke model may be equivalently realized in a variety of optomechanical or opto-magnonic settings, where it can serve as a testbed for studying high-order symmetry breaking and non-reciprocal interactions in open systems."

The approach to the steady state follows a power law, reflecting the interplay between Hamiltonian dynamics and vanishing dissipation. The decay exponents vary non-analytically with the ramp rate, exhibiting a cusp singularity, and $n$-point correlation functions factorize into one- and two-point contributions. Our exact solution anchors a universality class of open quantum systems with explicitly time-dependent dissipation."
2510.04253,Operational Quasiprobability in Quantum Thermodynamics: Work Extraction   by Coherence and Non-joint Measurability,2025-10-05T15:44:45Z,"We employ the operational quasiprobability (OQ) as a work distribution, which reproduces the Jarzynski equality and yields the average work consistent with the classical definition. The OQ distribution can be experimentally implemented through the end-point measurement and the two-point measurement scheme. Using this framework, we demonstrate the explicit contribution of coherence to the fluctuation, the average, and the second moment of work. In a two-level system, we show that non-joint measurability, a generalized notion of measurement incompatibility, can increase the amount of extractable work beyond the classical bound imposed by jointly measurable measurements. We further prove that the real part of Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability (KDQ) and the OQ are equivalent in two-level systems, and they are nonnegative for binary unbiased measurements if and only if the measurements are jointly measurable. In a three-level Nitrogen-vacancy center system, the OQ and the KDQ exhibit different amounts of negativities while enabling the same work extraction, implying that the magnitude of negativity is not a faithful indicator of nonclassical work. These results highlight that coherence and non-joint measurability play fundamental roles in the enhancement of work."
2510.04209,Quantum Error Correction with Superpositions of Squeezed Fock States,2025-10-05T13:52:08Z,"Bosonic codes, leveraging infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces for redundancy, offer great potential for encoding quantum information. However, the realization of a practical continuous-variable bosonic code that can simultaneously correct both single-photon loss and dephasing errors remains elusive, primarily due to the absence of exactly orthogonal codewords and the lack of an experiment-friendly state preparation scheme. Here, we propose a code based on the superposition of squeezed Fock states with an error-correcting capability that scales as $\propto\exp(-7r)$, where $r$ is the squeezing level. The codewords remain orthogonal at all squeezing levels. The Pauli-X operator acts as a rotation in phase space is an error-transparent gate, preventing correctable errors from propagating outside the code space during logical operations. In particular, this code achieves high-precision error correction for both single-photon loss and dephasing, even at moderate squeezing levels. Building on this code, we develop quantum error correction schemes that exceed the break-even threshold, supported by analytical derivations of all necessary quantum gates. Our code offers a competitive alternative to previous encodings for quantum computation using continuous bosonic qubits."
2510.04207,Quantum computing for heavy-ion physics: near-term status and future   prospects,2025-10-05T13:45:33Z,"We discuss recent advances in applying Quantum Information Science to problems in high-energy nuclear physics. After outlining key developments, open challenges, and emerging connections between these disciplines, we highlight recent results on the study of matter states, hard probes, and spin correlations using novel quantum technologies. This work summarizes the corresponding presentation delivered at the Quark Matter 2025 conference in Frankfurt, Germany."
2510.04200,Qubit entanglement from forward scattering,2025-10-05T13:34:56Z,"In the context of entanglement in relativistic $2\to 2$ scattering described by a perturbative $S$-matrix, we derive analytically the concurrence for a mixed final state of two qubits corresponding to a discrete quantum number of the scattered particles. Given an initial product state, the derived concurrence depends at the leading order on the real part of the inelastic forward amplitude and the initial state only. We also point out that the real part of the forward amplitude provides a subleading correction to the linearized entropy, reducing it by an amount that, for a computational-basis state, is equivalent to the relative entropy of coherence. We illustrate our findings with two examples of phenomenological interest: high-energy scattering of two scalar fields in the two-Higgs doublet model, and high-energy electron-positron annihilation."
2510.04198,Quantum Emission in Monolayer WSe2 Transferred onto InP Nanowires,2025-10-05T13:30:34Z,"Localized quantum emitters in transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have recently emerged as solid-state candidates for on-demand sources of single photons. Due to the role of strain in the site-selective creation of TMD emitters, their hybrid integration into photonic structures such as cavities and waveguides is possible using pick-and-place methods. Here we investigate quantum emission from a hybrid structure consisting of a monolayer of WSe2 interfaced with horizontally aligned InP nanowires (NWs). Our experiments reveal multiple narrow and bright emission peaks in the 715-785 nm spectral range and g(2)(0) as low as 0.049, indicating strong antibunching and good single photon purity. The faceted nature of III-V NWs provides unique opportunities for strain engineering, including the potential for placement of emitters on the top surface for optimal coupling. Our findings pave the way for realizing hybrid quantum light sources for integrated quantum photonics that could combine III-V quantum dots with TMD emitters into a single platform."
2510.04164,Clifford Circuits Augmented Grassmann Matrix Product States,2025-10-05T11:42:28Z,"Recent advances in combining Clifford circuits with tensor network (TN) states have shown that classically simulable disentanglers can significantly reduce entanglement, mitigating the bond-dimension bottleneck in TN simulations. In this work, we develop a variational TN framework based on Grassmann tensor networks, which natively encode fermionic statistics while preserving locality. By incorporating locally defined Clifford circuits within the fermionic formalism, we simulate benchmark models including the tight-binding and $t$-$V$ models. Our results show that Clifford disentangling removes the classically simulable component of entanglement, leading to a reduced bond dimension and improved accuracy in ground-state energy estimates. Interestingly, imposing the natural Grassmann-evenness constraint on the Clifford circuits significantly reduces the number of disentangling gates, from 720 to just 32, yielding a far more efficient implementation. These findings highlight the potential of Clifford-augmented Grassmann TNs as a scalable and accurate tool for studying strongly correlated fermionic systems, particularly in higher dimensions."
2510.04159,Proofs of quantum memory,2025-10-05T11:23:13Z,"With the rapid advances in quantum computer architectures and the emerging prospect of large-scale quantum memory, it is becoming essential to classically verify that remote devices genuinely allocate the promised quantum memory with specified number of qubits and coherence time. In this paper, we introduce a new concept, proofs of quantum memory (PoQM). A PoQM is an interactive protocol between a classical probabilistic polynomial-time (PPT) verifier and a quantum polynomial-time (QPT) prover over a classical channel where the verifier can verify that the prover has possessed a quantum memory with a certain number of qubits during a specified period of time. PoQM generalize the notion of proofs of quantumness (PoQ) [Brakerski, Christiano, Mahadev, Vazirani, and Vidick, JACM 2021]. Our main contributions are a formal definition of PoQM and its constructions based on hardness of LWE. Specifically, we give two constructions of PoQM. The first is of a four-round and has negligible soundness error under subexponential-hardness of LWE. The second is of a polynomial-round and has inverse-polynomial soundness error under polynomial-hardness of LWE. As a lowerbound of PoQM, we also show that PoQM imply one-way puzzles. Moreover, a certain restricted version of PoQM implies quantum computation classical communication (QCCC) key exchange."
2510.04085,Gluing Random Unitaries with Inverses and Applications to Strong   Pseudorandom Unitaries,2025-10-05T08:11:33Z,"Gluing theorem for random unitaries [Schuster, Haferkamp, Huang, QIP 2025] have found numerous applications, including designing low depth random unitaries [Schuster, Haferkamp, Huang, QIP 2025], random unitaries in ${\sf QAC0}$ [Foxman, Parham, Vasconcelos, Yuen'25] and generically shortening the key length of pseudorandom unitaries [Ananth, Bostanci, Gulati, Lin EUROCRYPT'25]. We present an alternate method of combining Haar random unitaries from the gluing lemma from [Schuster, Haferkamp, Huang, QIP 2025] that is secure against adversaries with inverse query access to the joined unitary. As a consequence, we show for the first time that strong pseudorandom unitaries can generically have their length extended, and can be constructed using only $O(n^{1/c})$ bits of randomness, for any constant $c$, if any family of strong pseudorandom unitaries exists."
2510.04062,Approaching the scaling limit of transport through lattices with   dephasing,2025-10-05T06:51:40Z,"We examine the stationary--state equations for lattices with generalized Markovian dephasing and relaxation. When the Hamiltonian is quadratic, the single--particle correlation matrix has a closed system of equations even in the presence of these two processes. The resulting equations have a vectorized form related to, but distinct from, Lyapunov's equation. We present an efficient solution that helps to achieve the scaling limit, e.g., of the current decay with lattice length. As an example, we study the super--diffusive--to--diffusive transition in a lattice with long--range hopping and dephasing. The approach enables calculations with up to $10^4$ sites, representing an increase of $10$ to $40$ times over prior studies. This enables a more precise extraction of the diffusion exponent, enhances agreement with theoretical results, and supports the presence of a phase transition. There is a wide range of problems that have Markovian relaxation, noise, and driving. They include quantum networks for machine--learning--based classification and extended reservoir approaches (ERAs) for transport. The results here will be useful for these classes of problems."
2510.04061,Non-Markovian protection of states from decay in quasi-PT-symmetric   systems,2025-10-05T06:47:58Z,"We consider a quasi-PT-symmetric system of two resonators, one of which interacts with a finite-size environment. The interaction with the environment leads to energy losses in the resonators, and the finite size of the environment leads to a non-Markovian dynamics of the relaxation process. We demonstrate that non-Markovian processes in the quasi-PT-symmetric system can make the states of the system infinitely living, loss-protected states, even in the absence of gain. There is a critical value of the interaction between the resonator and the environment below which any state of the system is loss-protected. When the interaction magnitude is greater than the critical value, depending on the coupling strength between the resonators, either one or both states are unprotected. We show that the boundaries of regions with different numbers of protected states are determined by the relaxation rates in the quasi-PT-symmetric system, calculated in the Markovian approximation. By changing the coupling strength between the resonators and the interaction magnitude between the resonator and the environment, the system switches between modes with two, one, or no loss-protected states. This makes it possible to realize stable PT-symmetric devices based on purely dissipative systems. The obtained results are applicable to quantum systems with single excitations, allowing the concept of PT symmetry to be extended to such systems."
2510.04059,Quadratically Shallow Quantum Circuits for Hamiltonian Functions,2025-10-05T06:43:18Z,"Many quantum algorithms for ground-state preparation and energy estimation require the implementation of high-degree polynomials of a Hamiltonian to achieve better convergence rates. Their circuit implementation typically relies on quantum signal processing (QSP), whose circuit depth is proportional to the degree of the polynomial. Previous studies exploit the Chebyshev polynomial approximation, which requires a Chebyshev series of degree $O(\sqrt{n\ln(1/\delta)})$ for an $n$-degree polynomial, where $\delta$ is the approximation error. However, the approximation is limited to only a few functions, including monomials, truncated exponential, Gaussian, and error functions. In this work, we present the most generalized function approximation methods for $\delta$-approximating linear combinations or products of polynomial-approximable functions with quadratically reduced-degree polynomials. We extend the list of polynomial-approximable functions by showing that the functions of cosine and sine can also be $\delta$-approximated by quadratically reduced-degree Laurent polynomials. We demonstrate that various Hamiltonian functions for quantum ground-state preparation and energy estimation can be implemented with quadratically shallow circuits."
2510.04047,Operator dependence and robustness of spacetime-localized response in a   quantum critical spin chain,2025-10-05T06:00:51Z,"We investigate the phenomenon of spacetime-localized response in a quantum critical spin system, with particular attention to how it depends on the spatial profile and operator content of the applied perturbation, as well as its robustness against increase of amplitude and temporal discretization. Motivated by recent theoretical proposals linking such response patterns to the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory correspondence, we numerically analyze the real-time dynamics of the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model at criticality using the time-evolving block decimation algorithm. We find that sharply localized and periodically recurring responses emerge only for specific types of perturbations, namely those that correspond to local density fields in the continuum limit. In contrast, perturbations involving other spin components produce conventional propagating excitations without localization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the response remains qualitatively robust when the time-dependent perturbation is approximated by a piecewise-linear function, highlighting the practical relevance of our findings for quantum simulation platforms with limited temporal resolution. Our results clarify the operator dependence of emergent bulk-like dynamics in critical spin chains and offer guidance for probing holographic physics in experimental settings."
2510.04011,A quantum information method for early universe with non-trivial sound   speed,2025-10-05T03:01:25Z,"Many quantum gravitational frameworks, such as DBI inflation, k-essence, and effective field theories obtained by integrating out heavy modes, can lead to a non-trivial sound speed. Meanwhile, our universe can be described as an open system. Under the non-trivial sound speed, we employ the method of open quantum systems combined with Arnoldi iterations to study the Krylov complexity throughout the early universe, including the inflationary, radiation-dominated, and matter-dominated epochs. A key ingredient in our analysis is the open two-mode squeezed state formalism and the generalized Lanczos algorithm. To numerically compute the Krylov complexity, we are the first time to derive the evolution equations for the parameters $r_k$ and $\phi_k$ within an open two-mode squeezed state. Our results indicate that the Krylov complexity exhibits a similar trend in both the standard case and the case with non-trivial sound speed. To distinguish between these two scenarios, we also investigate the Krylov entropy for completeness. The evolution of the Krylov entropy shows a clear difference between the standard case and the non-trivial sound speed case. Furthermore, based on the behavior of the Lanczos coefficients, we find that the case of non-trivial sound speed behaves as a maximally chaotic system. However, our numerical results suggest that the Krylov complexity does not saturate to a constant value due to the huge expansion of spacetime background. This study offers a new perspective for exploring the early universe through the quantum information."
2510.04005,Wormhole-Induced correlation: A Link Between Two Universes,2025-10-05T02:49:53Z,"Motivated by the profound connection between quantum mechanics and spacetime geometry, particularly the conjectured correspondence between wormholes and quantum entanglement as proposed in the ER=EPR framework, this study aims to investigate the influence of wormhole geometries on quantum information extraction. We examine the correlation-specifically mutual information (MI) and entanglement-extracted by two Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors from the quantum vacuum field in the presence of a BTZ wormhole featuring a null-like throat, also known as an Einstein-Rosen bridge. First, we analyze how the detector's position relative to the wormhole throat and the throat's size affect the extracted MI. Our results indicate that the wormhole enhances MI extraction, with maximal MI achieved when the detectors are located at specific image-symmetric points connected by the wormhole. By analyzing the behavior of the nonlocal contribution term and the classical noise term, it is found that the correlations extracted contain genuine non-classical components. This work highlights the feasibility of extracting quantum correlations through null-like wormhole geometries and provides a novel perspective for probing the potential relationship between spacetime topology and the nonlocal characteristics of quantum mechanics."
2510.03981,Coupling a $^{73}$Ge nuclear spin to an electrostatically defined   quantum dot,2025-10-05T00:12:32Z,"Single nuclear spins in silicon are a promising resource for quantum technologies due to their long coherence times and excellent control fidelities. Qubits and qudits have been encoded on donor nuclei, with successful demonstrations of Bell states and quantum memories on the spin-1/2 $^{31}$P and cat-qubits on the spin-7/2 $^{123}$Sb nuclei. Isoelectronic nuclear spins coupled to gate-defined quantum dots, such as the naturally occurring $^{29}$Si isotope, possess no additional charge and allow for the coupled electron to be shuttled without destroying the nuclear spin coherence. Here, we demonstrate the coupling and readout of a spin-9/2 $^{73}$Ge nuclear spin to a gate-defined quantum dot in SiMOS. The $^{73}$Ge nucleus was implanted by isotope-selective ion-implantation. We observe the hyperfine interaction (HFI) to the coupled quantum dot electron and are able to tune it from 180 kHz to 350 kHz, through the voltages applied to the lateral gate electrodes. This work lays the foundation for future spin control experiments on the spin-9/2 qudit as well as more advanced experiments such as entanglement distribution between distant nuclear spins or repeated weak measurements."
2510.03967,Higher-form entanglement asymmetry and topological order,2025-10-04T22:36:34Z,"We extend a recently defined measure of symmetry breaking, the entanglement asymmetry, to higher-form symmetries. In particular, we focus on Abelian topological order in two dimensions, which spontaneously breaks a 1-form symmetry. Using the toric code as a primary example, we compute the entanglement asymmetry and compare it to the topological entanglement entropy. We find that while the two quantities are not strictly equivalent, both are sub-leading corrections to the area law and can serve as order parameters for the topological phase. We generalize our results to non-chiral Abelian topological order and express the maximal entanglement asymmetry in terms of the quantum dimension. Finally, we discuss how the scaling of entanglement asymmetry correctly detects topological order in the deformed toric code, where 1-form symmetry breaking persists even in a trivial phase."
2510.03966,Ion-Based Characterization of Laser Beam Profiles for Quantum   Information Processing,2025-10-04T22:34:00Z,"Laser-driven operations are a common approach for engineering one- and two-qubit gates in trapped-ion arrays. Measuring key parameters of these lasers, such as beam sizes, intensities, and polarizations, is central to predicting and optimizing gate speeds and stability. Unfortunately, it is challenging to accurately measure these properties at the ion location within an ultra-high vacuum chamber. Here, we demonstrate how the ions themselves may be used as sensors to directly characterize the laser beams needed for quantum gate operations. Making use of the four-photon Stark Shift effect in $^{171}$Yb$^+$ ions, we measure the profiles, alignments, and polarizations of the lasers driving counter-propagating Raman transitions. We then show that optimizing the parameters of each laser individually leads to higher-speed Raman-driven gates with smaller susceptibility to errors. Our approach demonstrates the capability of trapped ions to probe their local environments and to provide useful feedback for improving system performance."
2510.03931,Metasurface-Based Dual-Basis Polarization Beam Splitter for efficient   entanglement witnessing,2025-10-04T20:23:25Z,"Entanglement witnessing is essential for quantum technologies such as computing, key distribution, and networking. Conventional bulk-optics methods require sequential reconfiguration across multiple polarization bases, limiting efficiency and scalability. We propose a metasurface-based analyzer that performs dual-basis (\sigma_z and \sigma_y) projections simultaneously by mapping them to orthogonal spatial modes. This allows direct access to the commuting two-photon correlators \langle \sigma_z \otimes \sigma_z \rangle and \langle \sigma_y \otimes \sigma_y \rangle required for entanglement witnessing. The metasurface design employs meta-atoms engineered to impart independent linear and circular phase delays through anisotropy and geometric control, resulting in polarization-dependent beam deflection that separates H/V and R/L components. This approach halves the measurement overhead compared to sequential analysis while offering a compact, integrable platform for chip-scale quantum photonics. The proposed scheme provides a path toward efficient entanglement verification with applications in quantum key distribution, quantum repeaters, and scalable quantum networks."
2510.03836,From Qubits to Rhythm: Exploring Quantum Random Walks in Rhythmspaces,2025-10-04T15:29:15Z,"A quantum computing algorithm for rhythm generation is presented, which aims to expand and explore quantum computing applications in the arts, particularly in music. The algorithm maps quantum random walk trajectories onto a rhythmspace -- a 2D interface that interpolates rhythmic patterns. The methodology consists of three stages. The first stage involves designing quantum computing algorithms and establishing a mapping between the qubit space and the rhythmspace. To minimize circuit depth, a decomposition of a 2D quantum random walk into two 1D quantum random walks is applied. The second stage focuses on biasing the directionality of quantum random walks by introducing classical potential fields, adjusting the probability distribution of the wave function based on the position gradient within these fields. Four potential fields are implemented: a null potential, a linear field, a Gaussian potential, and a Gaussian potential under inertial dynamics. The third stage addresses the sonification of these paths by generating MIDI drum pattern messages and transmitting them to a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW). This work builds upon existing literature that applies quantum computing to simpler qubit spaces with a few positions, extending the formalism to a 2D x-y plane. It serves as a proof of concept for scalable quantum computing-based generative random walk algorithms in music and audio applications. Furthermore, the approach is applicable to generic multidimensional sound spaces, as the algorithms are not strictly constrained to rhythm generation and can be adapted to different musical structures."
2510.03783,"Enhancement in phase sensitivity in displacement-assisted SU(1,1)   interferometer via photon recycling",2025-10-04T11:15:00Z,"We propose a novel method for enhancing phase estimation in the displacement-assisted SU(1,1) (DSU(1,1)) interferometer by incorporating the photon recycling technique, evaluated under single-intensity detection (SID) and homodyne detection (HD) schemes. Our analysis showed that utilizing the photon recycling technique, the photon-recycled DSU(1,1) interferometer performs better than the conventional DSU(1,1) interferometer for some conditions. We also showed that this improvement is possible in both SID and HD schemes. In addition, to discuss the maximum sensitivity achieved by our proposed model, we have calculated the quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (QCRB) within the framework and found that our proposed model approaches the QCRB. Therefore, we believe that our findings offer a promising new approach to improve phase sensitivity through photon recycling."
2510.03773,Reduction of the impact of the local valley splitting on the coherence   of conveyor-belt spin shuttling in $^{28}$Si/SiGe,2025-10-04T10:45:30Z,"Silicon quantum chips offer a promising path toward scalable, fault-tolerant quantum computing, with the potential to host millions of qubits. However, scaling up dense quantum-dot arrays and enabling qubit interconnections through shuttling are hindered by uncontrolled lateral variations of the valley splitting energy $E_{VS}$. We map $E_{VS}$ across a $40 \, $nm x $400 \, $nm region of a $^{28}$Si/Si$_{0.7}$Ge$_{0.3}$ shuttle device and analyze the spin coherence of a single electron spin transported by conveyor-belt shuttling. We observe that the $E_{VS}$ varies over a wide range from $1.5 \, \mu$eV to $200 \, \mu$eV and is dominated by SiGe alloy disorder. In regions of low $E_{VS}$ and at spin-valley resonances, spin coherence is reduced and its dependence on shuttle velocity matches predictions. Rapid and frequent traversal of low-$E_{VS}$ regions induces a regime of enhanced spin coherence explained by motional narrowing. By selecting shuttle trajectories that avoid problematic areas on the $E_{VS}$ map, we achieve transport over tens of microns with coherence limited only by the coupling to a static electron spin entangled with the mobile qubit. Our results provide experimental confirmation of the theory of spin-decoherence of mobile electron spin-qubits and present practical strategies to integrate conveyor-mode qubit shuttling into silicon quantum chips."
2510.03647,Accelerating Extended Benders Decomposition with Quantum-Classical   Hybrid Solver,2025-10-04T03:21:23Z,"We propose a quantum-classical hybrid method for solving large-scale mixed-integer quadratic problems (MIQP). Although extended Benders decomposition is effective for MIQP, its master problem which handles the integer and quadratic variables often becomes a computational bottleneck. To address this challenge, we integrate the D-Wave CQM solver into the decomposition framework to solve the master problem directly. Our results show that this hybrid approach efficiently yields near-optimal solutions and, for certain problem instances, achieves exponential speedups over the leading commercial classical solver. These findings highlight a promising computational strategy for tackling complex mixed-integer optimization problems."
2510.03645,The power of quantum circuits in sampling,2025-10-04T03:19:47Z,"We give new evidence that quantum circuits are substantially more powerful than classical circuits. We show, relative to a random oracle, that polynomial-size quantum circuits can sample distributions that subexponential-size classical circuits cannot approximate even to TV distance $1-o(1)$. Prior work of Aaronson and Arkhipov (2011) showed such a separation for the case of exact sampling (i.e. TV distance $0$), but separations for approximate sampling were only known for uniform algorithms.   A key ingredient in our proof is a new hardness amplification lemma for the classical query complexity of the Yamakawa-Zhandry (2022) search problem. We show that the probability that any family of query algorithms collectively finds $k$ distinct solutions decays exponentially in $k$."
2510.03622,Towards the simulation of higher-order quantum resources: a general   type-theoretic approach,2025-10-04T02:07:54Z,"Quantum resources exist in a hierarchy of multiple levels. At order zero, quantum states are transformed by linear maps (channels, or gates) in order to perform computations or simulate other states. At order one, gates and channels are transformed by linear maps (superchannels) in order to simulate other gates. To develop a full hierarchy of quantum resources, beyond those first two orders, and to account for the fact that quantum protocols can interconvert resources of different orders, we need a theoretical framework that addresses all orders in a uniform manner. We introduce a framework based on a system of types, which label the different kinds of objects that are present at different orders. We equip the framework with a parallel product operation that modifies and generalizes the tensor product so as to be operationally meaningful for maps of distinct and arbitrary orders. Finally, we introduce a family of convex cones that generalize the notion of complete positivity to all orders, with the aim of characterizing the objects that are physically admissible, facilitating an operational treatment of quantum objects at any order."
2510.03620,Compact non-degenerate entangled-photon source and   near-infrared-to-telecom quantum teleportation,2025-10-04T02:06:11Z,"The polarization-entangled photon source (PEPS) at non-degenerated wavelengths is pivotal to connect quantum systems working at different wavelengths, with the assistance of quantum teleportation. Here, a compact Sagnac-type photon source is designed and demonstrated, in which two photons with wavelengths at 810 and 1550~nm are highly entangled in polarization degree of freedom. The two photons are generated from a periodically poled lithium niobate crystal pumped with a 532~nm continuous-wave laser, via type-0 nondegenerate spontaneous parametric down-conversion. The polarization of three lights is rotated by a single periscope, which makes the Sagnac interferometer compact and stable. The generated two photons are with high brightness of $3\times10^4$ pairs/s/mW, which are highly entangled with fidelity of $0.985\pm0.002$. The entanglement is verified by violating the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality with $\mathcal S =2.756\pm0.007$. Finally, teleportation is demonstrated with this nondegenerate source, in which photonic states at 810~nm is teleported to 1550~nm with fidelity of $0.955\pm0.003$."
2510.03619,Broadband Quantum Photon Source in Step-Chirped Periodically Poled   Lithium Niobate Waveguide,2025-10-04T02:06:00Z,"Broadband nonlinear optical devices play a critical role in both classical and quantum optics. Here, we design and fabricate a 6.82-mm-long step-chirped periodically poled lithium niobate~(CPPLN) waveguide on lithium niobate on insulator, which enables quasi-phase matching over a broad bandwidth for second-harmonic generation~(SHG) and spontaneous parametric down-conversion~(SPDC). The SHG achieves an average efficiency of 54.4\%/W/cm$^2$ over the first-harmonic wavelength range of 1510~nm-1620~nm, paving the way for realizing SPDC across a wide range of pump wavelengths. For SPDC, by tuning the pump wavelength to 775~nm, 780~nm, and 785~nm, we achieve broadband photon-pair generation with a maximum full bandwidth and brightness up to 99~THz~(846~nm) and 20~GHz/mW/nm, respectively. Our findings provide an efficient and experiment-friendly approach for generating broadband photon pairs, which holds significant promise for advancing applications in quantum metrology."
2510.03618,Floquet Diamond Sensor with Optimal Precision,2025-10-04T02:05:41Z,"The diamond sensor has emerged as a promising platform for quantum sensing, enabling the estimation of physical quantities -- such as microwave~(MW) field -- with precision unattainable by classical counterpart. However, traditional diamond sensors suffer severe precision degradation when the signal MW is not resonant with the sensor transition frequency. Here, we propose and demonstrate a Floquet diamond sensor~(FDS) for high-precision off-resonant MW amplitude sensing without attenuating the strength of the signal MW. The periodic driven field effectively induces an quasi-energy shift that matches the off-resonant MW frequency. The measurement precision of FDS is characterized by quantum Fisher information, which approaches the ultimate precision -- Heisenberg limit -- within the coherent time. Furthermore, the FDS exhibits robust tolerance to practical control errors and is compatible with dynamical coupling protocol, enabling a robust and high-sensitivity magnetic sensing. Our results confirm the quantum advantage of quantum sensing and provide a practical technology for high-precision off-resonant MW sensing."
2510.03596,Quantum algorithm for Electromagnetic Field Analysis,2025-10-04T01:08:47Z,"Partial differential equations (PDEs) are central to computational electromagnetics (CEM) and photonic design, but classical solvers face high costs for large or complex structures. Quantum Hamiltonian simulation provides a framework to encode PDEs into unitary time evolution and has potential for scalable electromagnetic analysis. We formulate Maxwell's equations in the potential representation and embed governing equations, boundary conditions, and observables consistently into Hamiltonian form. A key bottleneck is the exponential growth of Hamiltonian terms for complex geometries; we examine this issue and show that logical compression can substantially mitigate it, especially for periodic or symmetric structures. As a proof of concept, we simulate optical wave propagation through a metalens and illustrate that the method can capture wavefront shaping and focusing behavior, suggesting its applicability to design optimization tasks. This work highlights the feasibility of Hamiltonian-based quantum simulation for photonic systems and identifies structural conditions favorable for efficient execution."
2510.03585,Reversing Annealing-Induced Optical Loss in Diamond Microcavities,2025-10-04T00:26:43Z,"A key challenge for quantum photonic technologies based on spin qubits is the creation of optically active defects in photonic resonators. Several of the most promising defects for quantum applications are hosted in diamond, and are commonly created through ion implantation and annealing at high temperatures and high vacuum. However, the impact of annealing on photonic resonator quality factor, a critical parameter governing their coupling to defects, has not been reported. In this work, we characterize the effect of annealing at temperatures >1200{\deg}C in high vacuum on the quality factors of diamond microdisk resonators. We investigate the optical losses associated with a non-diamond layer formed during annealing, and use Raman spectroscopy to analyze the resonator surface morphology and demonstrate that tri-acid cleaning can restore their optical quality factors. These results show the viability of creating defects in pre-fabricated diamond resonators without degrading their optical properties."
2510.03575,High-spin magnetic ground states of neutral dopant clusters in   semiconductors,2025-10-03T23:55:12Z,"High-spin states hold significant promise for classical and quantum information storage and emerging magnetic memory technologies. Here, we present a systematic framework for engineering such high-spin magnetic states in dopant clusters formed from substitutional impurities in semiconductors. In single-valley materials such as gallium arsenide, impurity states are hydrogenic and exchange interactions generally favor low-spin configurations, except in special geometries. In contrast, multivalley semiconductors exhibit oscillatory form factors in their exchange couplings, enabling the controlled suppression of selected hopping processes and exchange couplings. Exploiting this feature, we demonstrate how carefully arranged impurities in aluminum arsenide, germanium, and silicon can stabilize ground states with a net spin that scale extensively with system size. Within effective mass theory and the tight-binding approximation for hopping, we construct explicit examples ranging from finite clusters to extended lattices and fractal-like tilings. In two dimensions, we identify several favorable dopant geometries supporting a net spin equal to around half of the fully polarized value in the thermodynamic limit, including one which achieves over $70\%$ polarization. Our results provide a general design principle for harnessing valley degeneracy in semiconductors to construct robust high-spin states and outline a pathway for their experimental realization via precision implantation of dopants."
2510.03556,Next Generation Ta-STJ Sensor Arrays for BSM Physics Searches,2025-10-03T23:01:58Z,"The Beryllium Electron capture in Superconducting Tunnel junctions (BeEST) experiment uses superconducting tunnel junction (STJ) sensors to search for physics beyond the standard model (BSM) with recoil spectroscopy of the $\mathbf{^7}$Be EC decay into $\mathbf{^7}$Li. A pulsed UV laser is used to calibrate the STJs throughout the experiment with $\sim$20 meV precision. Phase-III of the BeEST experiment revealed a systematic calibration discrepancy between STJs. We found these artifacts to be caused by resistive crosstalk and by intensity variations of the calibration laser. For phase-IV of the BeEST experiment, we have removed the crosstalk by designing the STJ array so that each pixel has its own ground wire. We now also use a more stable UV laser for calibration. The new STJ arrays were fabricated at STAR Cryoelectronics and tested at LLNL and FRIB. They have the same high energy resolution of $\sim$1\textendash2~eV in the energy range of interest below 100~eV as before, and they no longer exhibit the earlier calibration artifacts. We discuss the design changes and the STJ array performance for the next phase of the BeEST experiment."
2510.03538,Optimising quantum data hiding,2025-10-03T22:12:06Z,"Quantum data hiding is the existence of pairs of bipartite quantum states that are (almost) perfectly distinguishable with global measurements, yet close to indistinguishable when only measurements implementable with local operations and classical communication are allowed. Remarkably, data hiding states can also be chosen to be separable, meaning that secrets can be hidden using no entanglement that are almost irretrievable without entanglement -- this is sometimes called `nonlocality without entanglement'. Essentially two families of data hiding states were known prior to this work: Werner states and random states. Hiding Werner states can be made either separable or globally perfectly orthogonal, but not both -- separability comes at the price of orthogonality being only approximate. Random states can hide many more bits, but they are typically entangled and again only approximately orthogonal. In this paper, we present an explicit construction of novel group-symmetric data hiding states that are simultaneously separable, perfectly orthogonal, and even invariant under partial transpose, thus exhibiting the phenomenon of nonlocality without entanglement to the utmost extent. Our analysis leverages novel applications of numerical analysis tools to study convex optimisation problems in quantum information theory, potentially offering technical insights that extend beyond this work."
2510.03530,Bloch Oscillations and Landau-Zener Transitions in Flat-Band Lattices   with Quadratic and Linear Band Touchings,2025-10-03T21:59:56Z,"Bloch oscillations (BOs) describe the coherent oscillatory motion of electrons in a periodic lattice under a constant external electric field. Deviations from pure harmonic wave packet motion or irregular Bloch oscillations can occur due to Zener tunneling (Landau-Zener Transitions or LZTs), with oscillation frequencies closely tied to interband coupling strengths. Motivated by the interplay between flat-band physics and interband coupling in generating irregular BOs, here we investigate these oscillations in Lieb and Kagome lattices using two complementary approaches: coherent transport simulations and scattering matrix analysis. In the presence of unavoidable band touchings, half-fundamental and fundamental BO frequencies are observed in Lieb and Kagome lattices, respectively -- a behavior directly linked to their distinct band structures. When avoided band touchings are introduced, distinct BO frequency responses to coupling parameters in each lattice are observed. Scattering matrix analysis reveals strong coupling and potential LZTs between dispersive bands and the flat band in Kagome lattices, with the quadratic band touching enhancing interband interactions and resulting in BO dynamics that is distinct from systems with linear crossings. In contrast, the Lieb lattice -- a three level system -- shows independent coupling between the flat band and two dispersive bands, without direct LZTs occurring between the two dispersive bands themselves. Finally, to obtain a unifying perspective on these results, we examine BOs during a strain-induced transition from Kagome to Lieb lattices, and link the evolution of irregular BO frequencies to changes in band connectivity and interband coupling."
2510.03489,"A Quantum-Secure Voting Framework Using QKD, Dual-Key Symmetric   Encryption, and Verifiable Receipts",2025-10-03T20:13:30Z,"Electronic voting systems face growing risks from cyberattacks and data breaches, which are expected to intensify with the advent of quantum computing. To address these challenges, we introduce a quantum-secure voting framework that integrates Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), Dual-Key Symmetric Encryption, and verifiable receipt mechanisms to strengthen the privacy, integrity, and reliability of the voting process. The framework enables voters to establish encryption keys securely, cast encrypted ballots, and verify their votes through receipt-based confirmation, all without exposing the vote contents. To evaluate performance, we simulate both quantum and classical communication channels using the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. Results demonstrate that the system can process large numbers of votes efficiently with low latency and minimal error rates. This approach offers a scalable and practical path toward secure, transparent, and verifiable electronic voting in the quantum era."
2510.03477,The quantum smooth label cover problem is undecidable,2025-10-03T19:54:07Z,"We show that the quantum smooth label cover problem is RE-hard. This contrasts with the quantum unique label cover problem, which can be decided efficiently by Kempe, Regev, and Toner (FOCS'08). Our result aligns with the RE-hardness of the quantum label cover problem, which follows from the celebrated MIP* = RE result of Ji, Natarajan, Vidick, Wright, and Yuen (ACM'21). Additionally, we show that the quantum oracularized smooth label cover problem is also RE-hard. This aligns with the alternative quantum unique games conjecture on the RE-hardness of the quantum oracularized unique label cover problem proposed by Mousavi and Spirig (ITCS'25). Our techniques employ a series of reductions from the halting problem to the quantum smooth label cover problem, and include a quantum-sound version of Feige's reduction from 3SAT to 3SAT5 (STOC'96), which may be of independent interest."
2510.03462,Single-Spin Nitrogen-Vacancy Magnetometer with Enhanced Static Field   Sensitivity,2025-10-03T19:34:54Z,"Precision sensing and imaging of weak static magnetic fields are crucial for a variety of emerging nanoscale applications. While nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond provide exceptional AC magnetic field sensitivity with nanoscale spatial resolution, their sensitivity to static (DC) magnetic fields is fundamentally limited by the short dephasing time (T2*) due to spin-spin interactions. In this work, we present a novel hybrid sensing approach that integrates a soft ferromagnetic microwire with a single near-surface NV center to amplify its response to external static magnetic fields. This hybrid configuration achieves a DC magnetic field sensitivity of 63 nT/sqrt(Hz) for a single NV center - about 500 times greater than conventional inhomogeneous broadening- or T2*-limited magnetometry, with potential for further enhancement. The compact and highly sensitive nature of this sensor opens new opportunities for quantum sensing applications involving the detection of static or slowly varying magnetic fields across diverse scientific and technological domains."
2510.03421,Optimizing and benchmarking the computation of the permanent of general   matrices,2025-10-03T18:32:04Z,"Evaluating the permanent of a matrix is a fundamental computation that emerges in many domains, including traditional fields like computational complexity theory, graph theory, many-body quantum theory and emerging disciplines like machine learning and quantum computing. While conceptually simple, evaluating the permanent is extremely challenging: no polynomial-time algorithm is available (unless $\textsc{P} = \textsc{NP}$). To the best of our knowledge there is no publicly available software that automatically uses the most efficient algorithm for computing the permanent. In this work we designed, developed, and investigated the performance of our software package which evaluates the permanent of an arbitrary rectangular matrix, supporting three algorithms generally regarded as the fastest while giving the exact solution (the straightforward combinatoric algorithm, the Ryser algorithm, and the Glynn algorithm) and, optionally, automatically switching to the optimal algorithm based on the type and dimensionality of the input matrix. To do this, we developed an extension of the Glynn algorithm to rectangular matrices. Our free and open-source software package is distributed via Github, at https://github.com/theochem/matrix-permanent."
2510.03398,Coherent matter wave emission from an atomtronic transistor,2025-10-03T18:00:01Z,"The atomtronic matter-wave triple-well transistor is theoretically predicted to exhibit current gain and act as a coherent matter-wave emitter. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of an atomtronic transistor composed of a triple-well potential -- source, gate, and drain -- modeled by the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation. We systematically explore the dependence of the drain population and the current on the source bias potential and the strength of the interatomic interaction. Our simulations reveal signatures of resonant tunneling when the source chemical potential aligns with discrete energy levels in the gate well, leading to coherent matter-wave emission in the drain. Contrary to previous many-body studies that predicted interaction-induced current gain via coupling to gate well modes, our results suggest that coherence in the drain is primarily governed by single-particle resonances, with no evident broadening from nonlinear coupling."
2510.03389,Quantum feature-map learning with reduced resource overhead,2025-10-03T18:00:00Z,"Current quantum computers require algorithms that use limited resources economically. In quantum machine learning, success hinges on quantum feature maps, which embed classical data into the state space of qubits. We introduce Quantum Feature-Map Learning via Analytic Iterative Reconstructions (Q-FLAIR), an algorithm that reduces quantum resource overhead in iterative feature-map circuit construction. It shifts workloads to a classical computer via partial analytic reconstructions of the quantum model, using only a few evaluations. For each probed gate addition to the ansatz, the simultaneous selection and optimization of the data feature and weight parameter is then entirely classical. Integrated into quantum neural network and quantum kernel support vector classifiers, Q-FLAIR shows state-of-the-art benchmark performance. Since resource overhead decouples from feature dimension, we train a quantum model on a real IBM device in only four hours, surpassing 90% accuracy on the full-resolution MNIST dataset (784 features, digits 3 vs 5). Such results were previously unattainable, as the feature dimension prohibitively drives hardware demands for fixed and search costs for adaptive ans\""atze. By rethinking feature-map learning beyond black-box optimization, this work takes a concrete step toward enabling quantum machine learning for real-world problems and near-term quantum computers."
2510.03227,Plugging Leaks in Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation and Verification,2025-10-03T17:57:59Z,"With the advent of quantum cloud computing, the security of delegated quantum computation has become of utmost importance. While multiple statistically secure blind verification schemes in the prepare-and-send model have been proposed, none of them achieves full quantum fault-tolerance, a prerequisite for useful verification on scalable quantum computers. In this paper, we present the first fault-tolerant blind verification scheme for universal quantum computations able to handle secret-dependent noise on the verifier's quantum device. Composable security of the proposed protocol is proven in the Abstract Cryptography framework.   Our main tools are two novel distillation protocols that turn secret-dependent noise into secret-independent noise. The first one is run by the verifier and acts on its noisy gates, while the second and more complex one is run entirely on the prover's device and acts on states provided by the verifier. Both are required to overcome the leakage induced by secret-dependent noise. We use these protocols to prepare states in the X-Y-plane whose noise is overwhelmingly secret-independent, which then allows us to verify with exponential confidence arbitrary fault-tolerant BQP computations."
2510.03225,Absence of quantum Darwinism as a resource in secure quantum   communication and computation,2025-10-03T17:57:26Z,"The emergence of classical world from underlying quantum mechanics is characterized by not only vanishing quantum correlations but also an unfolding of objectivity also known as quantum Darwinism. We show that the absence of this objectivity has a quantum advantage in cryptography and also provides the crucial missing link in efficient classical simulation of quantum circuits with zero discord. For this purpose, we consider a model of mixed state quantum computation where one is promised concordant states at all stages of the quantum circuit. A concordant quantum state has zero discord with respect to any part and there exists a basis made up of a tensor product of orthonormal local subsystem basis in which the density matrix is diagonal. Efficient classical simulation of concordant computation has surprisingly been an outstanding question in quantum information theory. We argue that a key ingredient of an efficient classical simulation algorithm, a knowledge of the local basis in which the multi-party state is diagonal, is made available by quantum Darwinism. Concordant states in the absence of quantum Darwinism cannot be efficiently simulated by existing methods and give a cryptographic advantage in communication. We show this by giving a protocol for secure quantum communication that exploits this insight. Our work also has implications for the quantum-classical border and we discuss how objectivity emerging out of Darwinism demarcates this border in three ways - empirical based on our observations and experience of objectivity, information theoretic due to the absence of any quantum correlations and lastly computational in the sense discussed above. Lastly, we show that the quantum-classical boundary as drawn by quantum Darwinism as well by what can be simulated efficiently in a mixed state quantum computation aligns with the boundary given by Hardy"
2510.03218,Cheat-Penalised Quantum Weak Coin-Flipping,2025-10-03T17:54:00Z,"Coin-flipping is a fundamental task in two-party cryptography where two remote mistrustful parties wish to generate a shared uniformly random bit. While quantum protocols promising near-perfect security exist for weak coin-flipping -- when the parties want opposing outcomes -- it has been shown that they must be inefficient in terms of their round complexity, and it is an open question of how space efficient they can be. In this work, we consider a variant called cheat-penalised weak coin-flipping in which if a party gets caught cheating, they lose $\Lambda$ points (compared to $0$ in the standard definition). We find that already for a small cheating penalty, the landscape of coin-flipping changes dramatically. For example, with $\Lambda=0.01$, we exhibit a protocol where neither Alice nor Bob can bias the result in their favour beyond $1/2 + 10^{-8}$, which uses $24$ qubits and $10^{16}$ rounds of communication (provably $10^{7}$ times better than any weak coin-flipping protocol with matching security). For the same space requirements, we demonstrate how one can choose between lowering how much a malicious party can bias the result (down to $1/2 + 10^{-10}$) and reducing the rounds of communication (down to $25,180$), depending on what is preferred. To find these protocols, we make two technical contributions. First, we extend the point game-protocol correspondence introduced by Kitaev and Mochon, to incorporate: (i) approximate point games, (ii) the cheat-penalised setting, and (iii) round and space complexity. Second, we give the first (to the best of our knowledge) numerical algorithm for constructing (approximate) point games that correspond to high security and low complexity. Our results open up the possibility of having secure and practical quantum protocols for multiparty computation."

We discuss how the remarkable progress in top-quark physics has opened the possibility of using the top quark as a tool to test quantum mechanics at the energy frontier. After reviewing the motivations for exploring beyond quantum mechanics, we present an example: probing post-quantum correlations at the energy frontier with boosted top quarks."
2510.03385,Mechanisms for Quantum Advantage in Global Optimization of Nonconvex   Functions,2025-10-03T17:40:31Z,"We present new theoretical mechanisms for quantum speedup in the global optimization of nonconvex functions, expanding the scope of quantum advantage beyond traditional tunneling-based explanations. As our main building-block, we demonstrate a rigorous correspondence between the spectral properties of Schr\""{o}dinger operators and the mixing times of classical Langevin diffusion. This correspondence motivates a mechanism for separation on functions with unique global minimum: while quantum algorithms operate on the original potential, classical diffusions correspond to a Schr\""{o}dinger operators with a WKB potential having nearly degenerate global minima. We formalize these ideas by proving that a real-space adiabatic quantum algorithm (RsAA) achieves provably polynomial-time optimization for broad families of nonconvex functions. First, for block-separable functions, we show that RsAA maintains polynomial runtime while known off-the-shelf algorithms require exponential time and structure-aware algorithms exhibit arbitrarily large polynomial runtimes. These results leverage novel non-asymptotic results in semiclassical analysis. Second, we use recent advances in the theory of intrinsic hypercontractivity to demonstrate polynomial runtimes for RsAA on appropriately perturbed strongly convex functions that lack global structure, while off-the-shelf algorithms remain exponentially bottlenecked. In contrast to prior works based on quantum tunneling, these separations do not depend on the geometry of barriers between local minima. Our theoretical claims about classical algorithm runtimes are supported by rigorous analysis and comprehensive numerical benchmarking. These findings establish a rigorous theoretical foundation for quantum advantage in continuous optimization and open new research directions connecting quantum algorithms, stochastic processes, and semiclassical analysis."
2510.03159,Slow dynamics from a nested hierarchy of frozen states,2025-10-03T16:30:01Z,"We identify the mechanism of slow heterogeneous relaxation in quantum kinetically constrained models (KCMs) in which the potential energy strength is controlled by a coupling parameter. The regime of slow relaxation includes the large-coupling limit. By expanding around that limit, we reveal a \emph{nested hierarchy} of states that remain frozen on time scales determined by powers of the coupling. The classification of such states, together with the evolution of their Krylov complexity, reveal that these time scales are related to the distance between the sites where facilitated dynamics is allowed by the kinetic constraint. While correlations within frozen states relax slowly and exhibit metastable plateaus that persist on time scales set by powers of the coupling parameter, the correlations in the rest of the states decay rapidly. We compute the plateau heights of correlations across all frozen states up to second-order corrections in the inverse coupling. Our results explain slow relaxation in quantum KCMs and elucidate dynamical heterogeneity by relating the relaxation times to the spatial separations between the active regions."
2510.03125,Spatial uniformity of g-tensor and spin-orbit interaction in germanium   hole spin qubits,2025-10-03T15:52:55Z,"Holes in Ge/SiGe heterostructures are now a leading platform for semiconductor spin qubits, thanks to the high confinement quality, two-dimensional arrays, high tunability, and larger gate structure dimensions. One limiting factor for the operation of large arrays of qubits is the considerable variation in qubit frequencies or properties resulting from the strongly anisotropic $g$-tensor. We study the $g$-tensors of six and seven qubits in an array with a Y geometry across two devices. We report a mean distribution of the tilts of the $g$-tensor's out-of-plane principal axis of around $1.1 \deg$, where nearby quantum dots are more likely to have a similar tilt. Independently of this tilt, and unlike simple theoretical predictions, we find a strong in-plane $g$-tensor anisotropy with strong correlations between neighboring quantum dots. Additionally, in one device where the principal axes of all g-tensors are aligned along the [100] crystal direction, we extract the spin-flip tunneling vector from adjacent dot pairs and find a pattern that is consistent with a uniform Dresselhaus-like spin-orbit field. The Y arrangement of the gate layout and quantum dots allows us to rule out local factors like electrostatic confinement shape or local strain as the origin of the preferential direction. Our results reveal long-range correlations in the spin-orbit interaction and $g$-tensors that were not previously predicted or observed, and could prove critical to reliably understand $g$-tensors in germanium quantum dots."
2510.03113,Bounds on Atomistic Disorder for Scalable Electron Shuttling,2025-10-03T15:40:11Z,"Electron shuttling is emerging as a key enabler of scalable silicon spin-qubit quantum computing, but fidelities are limited by atomistic disorder. We introduce a multiscale simulation framework combining time-dependent finite-element electrostatics and atomistic tight-binding to capture the impact of random alloying and interface roughness on the valley splitting and phase of shuttled electrons. We find that shuttling fidelities are strongly suppressed by interface roughness, with a sharp anomaly near the atomic-layer scale, setting quantitative guidelines to realize scalable shuttling."
2510.03112,Analytical solution of a free-fermion chain with time-dependent ramps,2025-10-03T15:38:58Z,"We provide an exact analytical solution of the single-particle Schr\""odinger equation for a chain of non-interacting fermions subject to a time-dependent linear potential, with its slope varied as an arbitrary function of time. The resulting dynamics exhibit self-similar behavior, with a structure reminiscent of the domain wall melting problem, albeit characterized by a nontrivial time-dependent length scale and phase. Building on this solution, we derive hydrodynamic predictions for the evolution of particle density, current, and entanglement entropy along the chain. In the special case of a sudden quench, the system develops a breathing interface region, which may be interpreted as a realization of Wannier-Stark localization, as previously suggested on the basis of hydrodynamic arguments."
2510.03099,Polarization dependence of spin-electric transitions in molecular   exchange qubits,2025-10-03T15:27:36Z,"Quasi-optical experiments are emerging as a powerful technique to probe magnetic transitions in molecular spin systems. However, the simultaneous presence of the electric- and magnetic-dipole induced transitions poses the challenge of discriminating between these two contributions. Besides, the identification of the spin-electric transitions can hardly rely on the peak intensity, because of the current uncertainties on the value of the spin-electric coupling in most molecular compounds. Here, we compute the polarizations required for electric- and magnetic-dipole induced transitions through spin-Hamiltonian models of molecular spin triangles. We show that the polarization allows a clear discrimination between the two kinds of transitions. In addition, it allows one to identify the physical origin of the zero-field splitting in the ground multiplet, a debated issue with significant implications on the coherence properties of the spin qubit implemented in molecular spin triangles."
2510.03090,Modified logarithmic Sobolev inequalities for CSS codes,2025-10-03T15:20:10Z,"We consider the class of Davies quantum semigroups modelling thermalization for translation-invariant Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes in D dimensions. We prove that conditions of Dobrushin-Shlosman-type on the quantum Gibbs state imply a modified logarithmic Sobolev inequality with a constant that is uniform in the system's size. This is accomplished by generalizing parts of the classical results on thermalization by Stroock, Zegarlinski, Martinelli, and Olivieri to the CSS quantum setting. The results in particular imply the rapid thermalization at any positive temperature of the toric code in 2D and the star part of the toric code in 3D, implying a rapid loss of stored quantum information for these models."
2510.03083,"To break, or not to break: Symmetries in adaptive quantum simulations, a   case study on the Schwinger model",2025-10-03T15:13:56Z,"We investigate the role of symmetries in constructing resource-efficient operator pools for adaptive variational quantum eigensolvers. In particular, we focus on the lattice Schwinger model, a discretized model of $1+1$ dimensional electrodynamics, which we use as a proxy for spin chains with a continuum limit. We present an extensive set of simulations comprising a total of $11$ different operator pools, which all systematically and independently break or preserve a combination of discrete translations, the conservation of charge (magnetization) and the fermionic locality of the excitations. Circuit depths are the primary bottleneck in current quantum hardware, and we find that the most efficient ans\""atze in the near-term are obtained by pools that $\textit{break}$ translation invariance, conserve charge, and lead to shallow circuits. On the other hand, we anticipate the shot counts to be the limiting factor in future, error-corrected quantum devices; our findings suggest that pools $\textit{preserving}$ translation invariance could be preferable for such platforms."
2510.03080,New Junction Condition and Casimir effect for Network CFT,2025-10-03T15:10:07Z,"Recently, BCFT and ICFT have been generalized to the CFT on networks (NCFT). A key aspect of NCFT is how we connect the CFTs in different edges at the nodes of the network. For a free scalar field, one naturally requires that the scalar fields are continuous at the nodes. In this paper, we introduce a new junction condition that instead requires the normal derivative of the scalar field to be continuous at the node. We demonstrate that this new junction condition is consistent with the variational principle and energy conservation. Furthermore, we provide an exact realization of it in a real physical system. As an application, we analyze the Casimir effect using both the traditional and the new junction conditions in networks formed by regular polyhedra. Our results indicate that the new junction condition generally results in a smaller Casimir effect."
2510.03077,Probability distribution reconstruction using circuit cutting applied to   a variational classifier,2025-10-03T15:04:34Z,"Significant efforts are being spent on building a quantum computer. At the same time, developments in quantum software are rapidly progressing. Insufficient quantum resources often are the problem when running quantum algorithms. New techniques can aid in using smaller quantum computers to run larger quantum algorithms. One of these techniques is circuit cutting. With this method, a circuit is broken into multiple pieces, each of which is run on quantum hardware independently and then recombined to obtain the overall answer. These circuit cutting techniques require additional circuit evaluations, which can form a bottleneck for algorithms requiring many interactions. This work explores the potential of circuit cutting techniques precisely in this regime of many interactions. We consider two different models, a standard method based on expectation values, and a novel method based on probability distribution reconstruction. Next, we compare two different training methods we call train-then-cut and cut-then-train and show that in practice, cut-then-train still produces good results. This observation brings closer the practical applicability of circuit cutting techniques, as a train-then-cut strategy is often infeasible. We conclude by implementing a cut and uncut circuit and find that circuit cutting helps achieve higher fidelity results."
2510.03057,Tradeoffs on the volume of fault-tolerant circuits,2025-10-03T14:39:31Z,"Dating back to the seminal work of von Neumann [von Neumann, Automata Studies, 1956], it is known that error correcting codes can overcome faulty circuit components to enable robust computation. Choosing an appropriate code is non-trivial as it must balance several requirements. Increasing the rate of the code reduces the relative number of redundant bits used in the fault-tolerant circuit, while increasing the distance of the code ensures robustness against faults. If the rate and distance were the only concerns, we could use asymptotically optimal codes as is done in communication settings. However, choosing a code for computation is challenging due to an additional requirement: The code needs to facilitate accessibility of encoded information to enable computation on encoded data. This seems to conflict with having large rate and distance. We prove that this is indeed the case, namely that a code family cannot simultaneously have constant rate, growing distance and short-depth gadgets to perform encoded CNOT gates. As a consequence, achieving good rate and distance may necessarily entail accepting very deep circuits, an undesirable trade-off in certain architectures and applications."
2510.03028,Boundary Time Crystals: Beyond Mean-Field Theory,2025-10-03T14:09:17Z,"Boundary time crystals are a class of exotic dissipative quantum phases that spontaneously break continuous time-translation symmetry in the thermodynamic limit of open quantum systems. In finite-size systems, the long-time evolution of boundary time crystals exhibits decaying oscillations that cannot be captured by widely used mean-field theory. To address this issue, we develop an effective approach called the stroboscopic rotating wave approximation, which provides a well approximate state for the long-time evolution of boundary time crystals under strong driving. In this approach, the order parameter exhibits both a long-time decaying envelope governed by an effective Lindblad superoperator and short-time oscillations dominated by a reduced quantum dynamical semigroup. Our results reveal that the competition among dephasing processes along three distinct directions induces persistent oscillations, marking the emergence of the boundary time crystal phase. We obtain the analytical expressions for the steady-state density operator, the oscillation period, and the decay rate of the order parameter in the regime where the coherent energy splitting exceeds the dissipation rate. Our work provides a beyond-mean-field theoretical tool for studying the dynamics of periodically driven open quantum systems and understanding the formation of time crystals."
2510.03024,Non-reciprocal Synchronization in Thermal Rydberg Ensembles,2025-10-03T14:05:41Z,"Optical non-reciprocity is a fundamental phenomenon in photonics. It is crucial for developing devices that rely on directional signal control, such as optical isolators and circulators. However, most research in this field has focused on systems in equilibrium or steady states. In this work, we demonstrate a room-temperature Rydberg atomic platform where the unidirectional propagation of light acts as a switch to mediate time-crystalline-like collective oscillations through atomic synchronization. We find that thermal-motion-induced coupling asymmetry, enabled by counterpropagating probe and control fields, generates persistent oscillations; conversely, co-propagation quenches this effect. We identify, through both numerical and analytical approaches, the criteria for realizing optical non-reciprocity within a synchronization regime. These results provide key insights for chiral quantum optics and promote the on-chip integration of non-reciprocal devices in nonequilibrium many-body systems."

The proposed approach extends the range of treatable potentials to include previously inaccessible cases, such as Coulomb and linear interactions. The method is validated across a variety of systems. A particular attention is given to the representation of both momentum and position probability densities."
2510.02940,MAQCY: Modular Atom-Array Quantum Computing with Space-Time Hybrid   Multiplexing,2025-10-03T12:31:16Z,"We present a modular atom-array quantum computing architecture with space-time hybrid multiplexing (MAQCY), a dynamic optical tweezer-based protocol for fully connected and scalable universal quantum computation. By extending the concept of globally controlled static dual-species Rydberg atom wires [1], we develop an entirely new approach using Q-Pairs, which consist of globally controlled and temporally multiplexed dual-species Rydberg blockaded atom and superatom pairs. Space-time hybrid multiplexing of Q-Pairs achieves O(N) linear scaling in the number of required physical qubits, while preserving coherence and mitigating circuit-depth limitations through in-situ atom replacement. To demonstrate MAQCY's versatility, we implement a three-qubit quantum Fourier transform using only global operations and atom transport. We also propose a concrete implementation using ytterbium isotopes, paving the way toward large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computing."
2510.02926,Scalable Quantum Optimisation using HADOF: Hamiltonian   Auto-Decomposition Optimisation Framework,2025-10-03T11:54:41Z,"Quantum Annealing (QA) and QAOA are promising quantum optimisation algorithms used for finding approximate solutions to combinatorial problems on near-term NISQ systems. Many NP-hard problems can be reformulated as Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimisation (QUBO), which maps naturally onto quantum Hamiltonians. However, the limited qubit counts of current NISQ devices restrict practical deployment of such algorithms. In this study, we present the Hamiltonian Auto-Decomposition Optimisation Framework (HADOF), which leverages an iterative strategy to automatically divide the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimisation (QUBO) Hamiltonian into sub-Hamiltonians which can be optimised separately using Hamiltonian based optimisers such as QAOA, QA or Simulated Annealing (SA) and aggregated into a global solution. We compare HADOF with Simulated Annealing (SA) and the CPLEX exact solver, showing scalability to problem sizes far exceeding available qubits while maintaining competitive accuracy and runtime. Furthermore, we realise HADOF for a toy problem on an IBM quantum computer, showing promise for practical applications of quantum optimisation."
2510.02888,Fermionic optimal transport,2025-10-03T10:51:23Z,"Quadratic Wasserstein distances are obtained between dynamical systems (with states as special case), on $\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded von Neumann algebras. This is achieved through a systematic translation from non-graded to $\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded transport plans, on usual and fermionic (or $\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded) tensor products respectively. The metric properties of these fermionic Wasserstein distances are shown, and their symmetries relevant to deviation of a system from quantum detailed balance are investigated. The latter is done in conjunction with the development of a complete mathematical framework for detailed balance in systems involving indistinguishable fermions."
2510.02883,Universal classical-quantum channel resolvability and private channel   coding,2025-10-03T10:40:44Z,"We address the problem of constructing fully universal private channel coding protocols for classical-quantum (c-q) channels. Previous work constructed universal decoding strategies, but the encoder relied on random coding, which prevents fully universal code construction. In this work, we resolve this gap by identifying an explicit structural property of codebooks -- namely, the spectral expansion of an associated Schreier graph -- that guarantees universal channel resolvability. Our analysis reveals how this property can be related to channel resolvability through the theory of induced representation. Our main technical result shows that when the transition matrix of a graph associated with a codebook has a large spectral gap, the channel output induced by uniformly sampled codewords is asymptotically indistinguishable from the target output distribution, independently of the channel. This establishes the first deterministic, channel-independent construction of resolvability codebooks.   Building on this, we construct a fully universal private channel coding protocol by combining it with universal c-q channel coding based on the Schur-Weyl duality. With appropriate modifications to the requirements on codebooks of universal c-q channel coding, we show that our fully universal private channel coding achieves the known optimal rate. This work thus sheds new light on the expander property of a graph in the context of secure communication."
2510.02863,A Hardware Accelerator for the Goemans-Williamson Algorithm,2025-10-03T10:01:58Z,"The combinatorial problem Max-Cut has become a benchmark in the evaluation of local search heuristics for both quantum and classical optimisers. In contrast to local search, which only provides average-case performance guarantees, the convex semidefinite relaxation of Max-Cut by Goemans and Williamson, provides worst-case guarantees and is therefore suited to both the construction of benchmarks and in applications to performance-critic scenarios.   We show how extended floating point precision can be incorporated in algebraic subroutines in convex optimisation, namely in indirect matrix inversion methods like Conjugate Gradient, which are used in Interior Point Methods in the case of very large problem sizes. Also, an estimate is provided of the expected acceleration of the time to solution for a hardware architecture that runs natively on extended precision. Specifically, when using indirect matrix inversion methods like Conjugate Gradient, which have lower complexity than direct methods and are therefore used in very large problems, we see that increasing the internal working precision reduces the time to solution by a factor that increases with the system size."
2510.02825,Quantum sensing with discrete time crystals in the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick   Model,2025-10-03T09:04:28Z,"Quantum phase transitions have been shown to be highly beneficial for quantum sensing, owing to diverging quantum Fisher information close to criticality. In this work we consider a periodically modulated Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model to show that discrete time crystal (DTC) phase transition in this setup can enable us to achieve quantum-enhanced high-precision sensing of field strength. We employ a detailed finite-size scaling analysis and a time-averaged Inverse Participation Ratio analysis to determine the critical properties of this second-order phase transition. Our studies provide a comprehensive understanding of how quantum criticality in DTCs involving long-range interactions can be harnessed for advanced quantum sensing applications."
2510.02807,Accurate and Effective Model for Coexistence of Classical and Quantum   Signals In Optical Fibers,2025-10-03T08:22:41Z,"The rising interest in quantum-level communication has resulted in proposals for coexistence schemes with classical signals within the same fiber optic channel, where the most recent proposals leverage novel fibers designed for space-division multiplexing (SDM) transmission. In all cases the large power difference between classical and quantum channels presents challenges for such schemes, as the classical signals generate interfering noise that corrupts the quantum signal. In this work, we discuss the main interference mechanisms in coexistence scenarios and provide a model to quantify their impact on the quantum signal quality. Analytical approximations in the model allow accurate and fast numerical solutions in the millisecond time-scale. The model accounts for out-of-band non-linear interference effects, namely spontaneous Raman scattering (SpRS) and four-wave-mixing (FWM) in both cases of single-mode and SDM fibers with weakly-coupled degenerate mode groups. Rayleigh and SpRS backscattering are considered in counter-propagating scenarios. Since broadband classical transmission is targeted, the model also accounts for the effect of stimulated Raman scattering (SRS)-induced power tilt. Use of the model in sample scenarios indicates that the interference noise power is minimized at the high end of the transmission band in both cases were the quantum is co- and counter-propagating with respect to the classical signals, with a preference of one or the other scheme depending on the link length and quantum signal center frequency. Our model reveals that FWM has negligible impact in counter-propagating schemes, but can be relevant in co-propagating schemes under certain scenarios. Nevertheless, the FWM interference can be mitigated by deallocating the classical signals adjacent to the quantum channel."
2510.02784,Any type of spectroscopy can be efficiently simulated on a quantum   computer,2025-10-03T07:39:31Z,"Spectroscopy is the most important method for probing the structure of molecules. However, predicting molecular spectra on classical computers is computationally expensive, with the most accurate methods having a cost that grows exponentially with molecule size. Quantum computers have been shown to simulate simple types of optical spectroscopy efficiently -- with a cost polynomial in molecule size -- using methods such as time-dependent simulations of photoinduced wavepackets. Here, we show that any type of spectroscopy can be efficiently simulated on a quantum computer using a time-domain approach, including spectroscopies of any order, any frequency range, and involving both electric and magnetic transitions. Our method works by computing any spectroscopic correlation function based on the corresponding double-sided Feynman diagram, the canonical description of spectroscopic interactions. The approach can be used to simulate spectroscopy of both closed and open molecular systems using both digital and analog quantum computers."
2510.02767,Dynamics of Quantum Entanglement Between Photon and Phonon Modes in a   Coulomb-coupled Optomechanical Cavity Magnonic Systems,2025-10-03T06:58:11Z,"Quantum entanglement is a fundamental phenomenon in quantum information science and a crucial resource for quantum technologies such as precision sensing, secure communication, and computation. In hybrid cavity magno-optomechanical systems, entanglement among cavity photons, magnons, and phonons enables manipulation of quantum states across different modes via radiation pressure-based light-matter interaction. We propose a hybrid optomechanical cavity-magnonic setup with Yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere allowing magnons to couple with photons via magnetic-dipole interaction. The system also uses optomechanical and electrostatic interactions to entangle cavity photons and mechanical resonators. We focus on how the magnon nonlinear Kerr effect and varying coupling strengths influence entanglement dynamics. By analysing nonlinear effects alongside other coupling parameters, we identify optimal conditions for initiating and sustaining robust entanglement between the motional modes (phonons) of two Coulomb-coupled mechanical resonators. Our model predicts that adding Coulomb interaction and magnon coupling enhances the degree and tunability of entanglement, making it more resilient to thermal baths at 3 K. This study addresses how to optimize and sustain phonon-phonon entanglement in complex hybrid quantum systems. These findings offer insights relevant to developing quantum memories for continuous variable quantum information processing and other quantum technologies."
2510.02725,Congestion bounds via Laplacian eigenvalues and their application to   tensor networks with arbitrary geometry,2025-10-03T04:58:40Z,"Embedding the vertices of arbitrary graphs into trees while minimizing some measure of overlap is an important problem with applications in computer science and physics. In this work, we consider the problem of bijectively embedding the vertices of an $n$-vertex graph $G$ into the leaves of an $n$-leaf rooted binary tree $\mathcal{B}$. The congestion of such an embedding is given by the largest size of the cut induced by the two components obtained by deleting any vertex of $\mathcal{B}$. The congestion $\mathrm{cng}(G)$ is defined as the minimum congestion obtained by any embedding. We show that $\lambda_2(G)\cdot 2n/9\le \mathrm{cng} (G)\le \lambda_n(G)\cdot 2n/9$, where $0=\lambda_1(G)\le \cdots \le \lambda_n(G)$ are the Laplacian eigenvalues of $G$. We also provide a contraction heuristic given by hierarchically spectral clustering the original graph, which we numerically find to be effective in finding low congestion embeddings for sparse graphs. We numerically compare our congestion bounds on different families of graphs with regular structure (hypercubes and lattices), random graphs, and tensor network representations of quantum circuits. Our results imply lower and upper bounds on the memory complexity of tensor network contraction in terms of the underlying graph."
2510.02710,Complementarity Reveals Entanglement Sharing in Sequential Quantum   Measurements,2025-10-03T04:22:40Z,"We investigate entanglement sharing in a two-qubit sequential measurement scenario using three complementary classical correlation metrics: mutual information (I), sum of conditional probabilities (S), and the Pearson correlation coefficient (C). By investigating both weak measurement and probabilistic projective measurement (PPM) strategies in unilateral and bilateral scenarios, the phenomenon of entanglement sharing is conclusively certified when multiple pairs of classical correlation metrics simultaneously exceed their thresholds. Our investigation reveals that weak measurement strategies are more favorable than PPM for exhibiting entanglement sharing, regardless of the scenario. Furthermore, the mutual information criterion fails to characterize entanglement sharing in the bilateral scenario. While, the Pearson correlation criterion (C) is proven to be the most robust across all strategies and scenarios. These findings unveil a critical trade-off between measurement disturbance and complementary correlation recovery, which is essential for quantum resource reuse problems."
2510.02685,Construction of the Complete Set of Maximally Entangled Basis Vectors   for N-Qubit Systems,2025-10-03T02:57:06Z,"In this study, we first use a three-qubit system as an example to demonstrate the construction of quantum circuits for the eight maximally entangled basis vectors, subsequently extending the approach to N-qubit systems. We employ a random-number approach to generate maximally entangled basis vectors and their corresponding circuits, while also detailing the required number of single-qubit and CNOT gates. This approach not only provides a solid theoretical foundation but also establishes a practical technique for technological applications, bypassing the difficulty of storing large-scale encoding data."
2510.02603,Fast surrogate modelling of EIT in atomic quantum systems using LSTM   neural networks,2025-10-02T22:30:40Z,"Simulations of optical quantum systems are essential for the development of quantum technologies. However, these simulations are often computationally intensive, especially when repeated evaluations are required for data fitting, parameter estimation, or real-time feedback. To address this challenge, we develop a Long Short-Term Memory neural network capable of replicating the output of these simulations with high accuracy and significantly reduced computational cost. Once trained, the surrogate model produces spectra in milliseconds, providing a speed-up of 5000x relative to traditional numerical solvers. We focus on applying this technique to Doppler-broadened Electromagnetically Induced Transparency in a ladder-type scheme for Rydberg-based sensing, achieving near-unity agreement with the physics solver for resonant and off-resonant regimes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the LSTM model on this representative optical quantum system, establishing it as a surrogate tool capable of supporting real-time signal processing and feedback-based optimisation."
2510.02581,Basis-independent coherence and its distribution in de Sitter spacetime,2025-10-02T21:41:49Z,"Quantum coherence in curved spacetime offers a fresh window into the interplay between gravity, thermality, and quantum resources. While previous work has shown that Markovian evolution can generate entanglement and other nonclassical correlations in de Sitter backgrounds, the basis-dependent nature of coherence has so far limited its unambiguous interpretation. Here, we introduce a basis-independent framework to quantify not only the total coherence of two comoving detectors, but also its collective and localized contributions, and we trace how each of these decomposed measures varies with the inverse of Gibbons-Hawking temperature. By treating the detectors as open quantum systems interacting with a massless scalar field in the Bunch-Davies and squeezed alpha-vacua, we find that non-thermal squeezing substantially enhances extractable coherence, even under strong thermal effects. Our results demonstrate how basis-independent coherence in de Sitter spacetime can serve as a robust resource for relativistic quantum information protocols."
2510.02550,Quantum simulation of carbon capture in periodic metal-organic   frameworks,2025-10-02T20:37:23Z,"Carbon capture is vital for decarbonizing heavy industries such as steel and chemicals. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), with their high surface area and structural tunability, are promising materials for CO2 capture. This study focuses on Fe-MOF-74, a magnetic Mott insulator with exposed metal sites that enhance CO2 adsorption. Its strongly correlated electronic structure challenges standard DFT methods, which often yield inconsistent predictions. We initially benchmark adsorption energies using various DFT functionals, revealing substantial variability and underscoring the need for more accurate approaches, such as those provided by quantum computing. However, practical quantum algorithms are far less established for simulations of periodic materials, particularly when the plane-wave basis set, often comprising tens of thousands of basis vectors, is used. To address this, we employ an active space reduction strategy based on Wannier functions and natural orbital selection. Localized orbitals around the adsorption site are identified, and MP2 natural orbitals are used to improve convergence of correlation energies. Adsorption energies are then computed using a quantum number-preserving ansatz within the variational quantum eigensolver framework. In addition to classical simulations, we conduct quantum experiments using the sample-based quantum diagonalization method. Although current hardware limits the size of feasible simulations, our approach offers a more efficient and scalable path forward. These results advance the applicability of quantum algorithms to realistic models of carbon capture and periodic materials more broadly."
2510.02541,Emulation of Coherent Absorption of Quantum Light in a Programmable   Linear Photonic Circuit,2025-10-02T20:18:50Z,"Non-Hermitian quantum systems, governed by nonunitary evolution, offer powerful tools for manipulating quantum states through engineered loss. A prime example is coherent absorption, where quantum states undergo phase-dependent partial or complete absorption in a lossy medium. Here, we demonstrate a fully programmable implementation of nonunitary transformations that emulate coherent absorption of quantum light using a programmable integrated linear photonic circuit, with loss introduced via coupling to an ancilla mode [Phys. Rev. X 8, 021017; 2018]. Probing the circuit with a single-photon dual-rail state reveals phase-controlled coherent tunability between perfect transmission and perfect absorption. A two-photon NOON state input, by contrast, exhibits switching between deterministic single-photon and probabilistic two-photon absorption. Across a range of input phases and circuit configurations, we observe nonclassical effects such as anti-coalescence and bunching, along with continuous and coherent tuning of output Fock state probability amplitudes. Classical Fisher information analysis reveals phase sensitivity peaks of 0.79 for single-photon states and 3.7 for NOON states, exceeding the shot-noise limit of 2 and approaching the Heisenberg limit of 4. The experiment integrates quantum state generation, programmable photonic circuitry, and photon-number-resolving detection, establishing ancilla-assisted circuits as powerful tools for programmable quantum state engineering, filtering, multiplexed sensing, and nonunitary quantum simulation."
2510.02505,Many Retrocausal Worlds: A Foundation for Quantum Probability,2025-10-02T19:21:08Z,"Recent accounts of probability in the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics are vulnerable due to their dependence on probability theory per se. For this reason, the many worlds interpretation continues to suffer from the incoherence and quantitative problems. After discussing various theories of probability, I discuss the incoherence problem and argue that self-locating probabilities centered in time-extended worlds can solve it. I then discuss and refute various solutions to the quantitative problem. I argue that the only tenable way to ground these self-locating probabilities is to identify the mathematical form of the Born rule as a generic pattern in a time-extended wavefunction, and to distribute degrees of belief over the region of wavefunction occupied by this pattern. I then outline a time-symmetric version of quantum mechanics - the Fixed Point Formulation - which, interpreted within a time-symmetric Everettian framework, can provide the foundation for a theory of quantum probability."
2510.02497,Amplitude-based Input Attribution in Quantum Learning via Integrated   Gradients,2025-10-02T19:00:41Z,"Quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms have demonstrated early promise across hardware platforms, but remain difficult to interpret due to the inherent opacity of quantum state evolution. Widely used classical interpretability methods, such as integrated gradients and surrogate-based sensitivity analysis, are not directly compatible with quantum circuits due to measurement collapse and the exponential complexity of simulating state evolution. In this work, we introduce HATTRIQ, a general-purpose framework to compute amplitude-based input attribution scores in circuit-based QML models. HATTRIQ supports the widely-used input amplitude embedding feature encoding scheme and uses a Hadamard test-based construction to compute input gradients directly on quantum hardware to generate provably faithful attributions. We validate HATTRIQ on classification tasks across several datasets (Bars and Stripes, MNIST, and FashionMNIST)."
2510.02494,On a Class of Time-Dependent Non-Hermitian Hamiltonians,2025-10-02T18:59:12Z,"We study a class of time-dependent (TD) non-Hermitian Hamiltonians $H(t)$ that can be transformed into a time-independent pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H}_{0}^{PH}$ using a suitable TD unitary transformation $F(t)$. The latter can in turn be related to a Hermitian Hamiltonian $h$ by a similarity transformation, $h=\rho \mathcal{H}_{0}^{PH} \rho^{-1}$ where $\rho$ is the Dyson map. Accordingly, once the Schr\""{o}dinger equation for the Hermitian Hamiltonian $h$ is solved, the general solution of the initial system can be deduced. This allows to define the appropriate $\tilde{\eta}(t)$-inner product for the Hilbert space associated with $H(t)$, where $\tilde{\eta}(t)=F^{\dagger}(t)\eta F(t)$ and $\eta=\rho^{\dagger}\rho$ is the metric operator. This greatly simplifies the computation of the relevant uncertainty relations for these systems. As an example, we consider a model of a particle with a TD mass subjected to a specific TD complex linear potential. We thus obtain two Hermitian Hamiltonians, namely that of the standard harmonic oscillator and that of the inverted oscillator. For both cases, the auxiliary equation admits a solution, and the exact analytical solutions are squeezed states given in terms of the Hermite polynomials with complex coefficients. Moreover, when the Hermitian Hamiltonian is that of the harmonic oscillator, the position-momentum uncertainty relation is real and greater than or equal to $\hbar/2$, thereby confirming its consistency."
2510.02466,Computational access to lattice and long-wavelength physics in quantum   mutual information,2025-10-02T18:21:13Z,"Quantum mutual information is an important tool for characterizing correlations in quantum many-body systems, but its numerical evaluation is often prohibitively expensive. While some variants of R\'enyi Mutual Information (RMI) are computationally more tractable, it is not clear whether they correctly capture the long-wavelength physics or are dominated by UV effects, which is of key importance in lattice simulations. We analyze the relevance of lattice effects on the family of $\alpha$-$z$ R\'enyi mutual informations for ground states of models with conformal field theory descriptions. On the example of massless free fermions we identify distinct regions in the $\alpha$-$z$ plane, where RMI corrections due to the lattice are relevant or irrelevant. We further support these findings with MPS calculations on the transverse field Ising model (TFIM). Our results, accompanied by the open-source Julia package QMICalc$.$jl, provide guidance to using RMI in quantum-many body physics numerical computations."
2510.02454,Characterizing Superconducting Qubits using Averaged Circuit Eigenvalue   Sampling,2025-10-02T18:03:38Z,"Efficient characterization of noise during quantum gate operations is an essential step to building and scaling up a quantum computer. One such protocol is averaged circuit eigenvalue sampling (ACES) which efficiently characterizes a noisy gate set by reconstructing a Pauli noise model for a each gate. Here we utilize the ACES protocol to characterize two coupled superconducting qubits. For accurate reconstruction, we tailor the noise via Pauli twirling and account for measurement errors. We verify the accuracy of the protocol by comparing the predicted gate fidelities to that extracted from conventional benchmarking approaches, such as interleaved randomized benchmarking. Furthermore, we demonstrate the efficacy of ACES in accurately identifying specific noise sources by reconstructing injected phase errors in the two-qubit gates."
2510.02440,Statistical Signatures of Integrable and Non-Integrable Quantum   Hamiltonians,2025-10-02T18:00:03Z,"Integrability is a cornerstone of classical mechanics, where it has a precise meaning. Extending this notion to quantum systems, however, remains subtle and unresolved. In particular, deciding whether a quantum Hamiltonian - viewed simply as a matrix - defines an integrable system is far from obvious, yet crucial for understanding non-equilibrium dynamics, spectral correlations, and correlation functions in many-body physics. We develop a statistical framework that approaches quantum integrability from a probabilistic standpoint. A key observation is that integrability requires a finite probability of vanishing energy gaps. Building on this, we propose a two-step protocol to distinguish integrable from non-integrable Hamiltonians. First, we apply a systematic Monte Carlo decimation of the spectrum, which exponentially compresses the Hilbert space and reveals whether level spacings approach Poisson statistics or remain mixed. The termination point of this decimation indicates the statistical character of the spectrum. Second, we analyze $k$-step gap distributions, which sharpen the distinction between Poisson and mixed statistics. Our procedure applies to Hamiltonians of any finite size, independent of whether their structure involves a few blocks or an exponentially fragmented Hilbert space. As a benchmark, we implement the protocol on quantum Hamiltonians built from the permutation group $\mathcal{S}_N$, demonstrating both its effectiveness and generality."
2510.02428,Utility-Scale Quantum State Preparation: Classical Training using Pauli   Path Simulation,2025-10-02T18:00:00Z,"We use Pauli Path simulation to variationally obtain parametrized circuits for preparing ground states of various quantum many-body Hamiltonians. These include the quantum Ising model in one dimension, in two dimensions on square and heavy-hex lattices, and the Kitaev honeycomb model, all at system sizes of one hundred qubits or more, beyond the reach of exact state-vector simulation, thereby reaching utility scale. We benchmark the Pauli Path simulation results against exact ground-state energies when available, and against density-matrix renormalization group calculations otherwise, finding strong agreement. To further assess the quality of the variational states, we evaluate the magnetization in the x and z directions for the quantum Ising models and compute the topological entanglement entropy for the Kitaev honeycomb model. Finally, we prepare approximate ground states of the Kitaev honeycomb model with 48 qubits, in both the gapped and gapless regimes, on Quantinuum's System Model H2 quantum computer using parametrized circuits obtained from Pauli Path simulation. We achieve a relative energy error of approximately $5\%$ without error mitigation and demonstrate the braiding of Abelian anyons on the quantum device beyond fixed-point models."
2510.02429,Uncovering origins of heterogeneous superconductivity in   La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using quantum sensors,2025-10-02T18:00:00Z,"The family of nickelate superconductors have long been explored as analogs of the high temperature cuprates. Nonetheless, the recent discovery that certain stoichiometric nickelates superconduct up to high $T_c$ under pressure came as a surprise. The mechanisms underlying the superconducting state remain experimentally unclear. In addition to the practical challenges posed by working in a high pressure environment, typical samples exhibit anomalously weak diamagnetic responses, which have been conjectured to reflect inhomogeneous `filamentary' superconducting states. We perform wide-field, high-pressure, optically detected magnetic resonance spectroscopy to image the local diamagnetic responses of as grown La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ samples \emph{in situ}, using nitrogen vacancy quantum sensors embedded in the diamond anvil cell. These maps confirm significant inhomogeneity of the functional superconducting responses at the few micron scale. By spatially correlating the diamagnetic Meissner response with both the local tensorial stress environment, also imaged \emph{in situ}, and stoichiometric composition, we unravel the dominant mechanisms suppressing and enhancing superconductivity. Our wide-field technique simultaneously provides a broad view of sample behavior and excellent local sensitivity, enabling the rapid construction of multi-parameter phase diagrams from the local structure-function correlations observed at the sub-micron pixel scale."
2510.02430,Mitigating the barren plateau problem in linear optics,2025-10-02T18:00:00Z,"We demonstrate a significant speedup of variational quantum algorithms that use discrete variable boson sampling when the parametrised phase shifters are constrained to have two distinct eigenvalues. This results in a cost landscape with less local minima and barren plateaus regardless of the problem, ansatz or circuit layout. This works without reliance on any classical pre-processing and allows for the fast gradient-free Rotosolve algorithm to be used. We propose three ways to achieve this by using either non-linear optics, measurement-induced non-linearities, or entangled resource states simulating fermionic statistics. The latter two require linear optics only, allowing for implementation with widely-available technology today. We show this outperforms the best-known boson sampling variational algorithm for all tests we conducted."
2510.02290,Beyond Belief Propagation: Cluster-Corrected Tensor Network Contraction   with Exponential Convergence,2025-10-02T17:58:30Z,"Tensor network contraction on arbitrary graphs is a fundamental computational challenge with applications ranging from quantum simulation to error correction. While belief propagation (BP) provides a powerful approximation algorithm for this task, its accuracy limitations are poorly understood and systematic improvements remain elusive. Here, we develop a rigorous theoretical framework for BP in tensor networks, leveraging insights from statistical mechanics to devise a \emph{cluster expansion} that systematically improves the BP approximation. We prove that the cluster expansion converges exponentially fast if an object called the \emph{loop contribution} decays sufficiently fast with the loop size, giving a rigorous error bound on BP. We also provide a simple and efficient algorithm to compute the cluster expansion to arbitrary order. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on the two-dimensional Ising model, where we find that our method significantly improves upon BP and existing corrective algorithms such as loop series expansion. Our work opens the door to a systematic theory of BP for tensor networks and its applications in decoding classical and quantum error-correcting codes and simulating quantum systems."
2510.02275,Lower bounds on the complexity of preparing mixed states,2025-10-02T17:50:59Z,"We establish a relationship between the correlations in a many-qubit mixed state and the minimum circuit depth needed for its preparation. If the mutual information between two subsystems exceeds the mutual information between one of those subsystems and the environment, which purifies the mixed state of the system, then the past lightcones of the subsystems must intersect one another. This results in a lower bound on the circuit depth of any ensemble of geometrically local unitaries that prepares the state to some specified degree of approximation. As an application, we derive lower bounds on the circuit depth needed to prepare thermal states of one-dimensional quantum critical systems described by conformal field theory, showing that the depth diverges as temperature is decreased up to a cutoff set by the preparation error."
2510.02267,Quantum gates in coupled quantum dots controlled by coupling modulation,2025-10-02T17:46:42Z,"We studied the dynamics of a pair of single-electron double quantum dots (DQD) under longitudinal and transverse static magnetic fields and time-dependent harmonic modulation of their interaction couplings. We propose to modulate the tunnel coupling between the QDs to produce one-qubit gates and the exchange coupling between DQDs to generate entangling gates, the set of operations required for quantum computing. We developed analytical approximations to set the conditions to control the qubits and applied them to numerical calculations to test the accuracy and robustness of the analytical model. The results shows that the unitary evolution of the two-electron state performs the designed operations even under conditions shifted from the ideal ones."
2510.02251,Reproducible Builds for Quantum Computing,2025-10-02T17:38:40Z,"Reproducible builds are a set of software development practices that establish an independently verifiable path from source code to binary artifacts, helping to detect and mitigate certain classes of supply chain attacks. Although quantum computing is a rapidly evolving field of research, it can already benefit from adopting reproducible builds. This paper aims to bridge the gap between the quantum computing and reproducible builds communities. We propose a generalization of the definition of reproducible builds in the quantum setting, motivated by two threat models: one targeting the confidentiality of end users' data during circuit preparation and submission to a quantum computer, and another compromising the integrity of quantum computation results. This work presents three examples that show how classical information can be hidden in transpiled quantum circuits, and two cases illustrating how even minimal modifications to these circuits can lead to incorrect quantum computation results. Our work provides initial steps towards a framework for reproducibility in quantum software toolchains."
2510.02246,The (PXP)$^2$ model: long-range quantum scars in optical cavities,2025-10-02T17:33:41Z,"Rydberg-cavity systems are emerging as promising platforms for quantum simulation and quantum information processing. These hybrid architectures combine two complementary interaction mechanisms: cavity photons mediate collective long-range couplings, while Rydberg excitations generate strong short-range interactions. Together, they offer a setting for engineering many-body phases characterized by a hierarchy of interactions across widely different length scales. In this work, we introduce a minimal and scalable model for such systems. Focusing on the strong Rydberg blockade regime, we restrict the Hilbert space to the subspace enforced by the blockade, yielding a kinetically constrained long-range model in one spatial dimension. This approach both captures the physics of Rydberg-cavity experiments in the regime of strong Rydberg interactions and provides a conceptually transparent framework for studying the interplay of long-range and short-range interactions. At equilibrium, in addition to paramagnetic and N\'eel-ordered phases, the system supports a blockaded ferromagnetic/superradiant phase, distinct from the conventional superradiant phase. Out of equilibrium, we identify long-range quantum many-body scars, which are atypical nonthermal eigenstates that evade the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, and giving rise to slow entanglement growth. In contrast to the linear-in-time entanglement growth characteristic of short-range scarred models, these long-range scars exhibit logarithmic entanglement dynamics. Our results establish a minimal yet versatile framework for Rydberg-cavity systems, and provide a stepping stone for future theoretical and experimental studies of this frontier platform in quantum many-body physics."
2510.02231,Emergent Hierarchy in Localized States of Organic Quantum Chains,2025-10-02T17:19:31Z,"Organic Quantum Chains (OQCs) represent a newly synthesized class of carbon-based nanostructures whose quasi-one-dimensional nature gives rise to unconventional electronic and transport phenomena. Here we investigate the electronic and transport properties of recently synthesized OQCs [Nature Communications, 12, 5895 (2021)]. Structural stability was first assessed through molecular dynamics relaxation combined with density functional theory (DFT). The optimized coordinates are then used in a tight-binding model with exponentially decaying hopping parameterization, which reproduces the DFT results with high accuracy. Our calculations reveal a robust and nearly constant energy gap across several OQC configurations, in agreement with experimental data. We also identify emergent hierarchical states, characterized by distinct localization behaviors within sets of localized bands. Finally, we analyze different transport responses in scenarios involving the one-dimensional OQC coupled to carbon corrals, as observed in the experimental data, highlighting their potential as promising systems for application in carbon nanodevices."
2510.02218,Quantum Fisher information matrices from Rényi relative entropies,2025-10-02T17:02:48Z,"Quantum generalizations of the Fisher information are important in quantum information science, with applications in high energy and condensed matter physics and in quantum estimation theory, machine learning, and optimization. One can derive a quantum generalization of the Fisher information matrix in a natural way as the Hessian matrix arising in a Taylor expansion of a smooth divergence. Such an approach is appealing for quantum information theorists, given the ubiquity of divergences in quantum information theory. In contrast to the classical case, there is not a unique quantum generalization of the Fisher information matrix, similar to how there is not a unique quantum generalization of the relative entropy or the R\'enyi relative entropy. In this paper, I derive information matrices arising from the log-Euclidean, $\alpha$-$z$, and geometric R\'enyi relative entropies, with the main technical tool for doing so being the method of divided differences for calculating matrix derivatives. Interestingly, for all non-negative values of the R\'enyi parameter $\alpha$, the log-Euclidean R\'enyi relative entropy leads to the Kubo-Mori information matrix, and the geometric R\'enyi relative entropy leads to the right-logarithmic derivative Fisher information matrix. Thus, the resulting information matrices obey the data-processing inequality for all non-negative values of the R\'enyi parameter $\alpha$ even though the original quantities do not. Additionally, I derive and establish basic properties of $\alpha$-$z$ information matrices resulting from the $\alpha$-$z$ R\'enyi relative entropies. For parameterized thermal states and time-evolved states, I establish formulas for their $\alpha$-$z$ information matrices and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for estimating them, with applications in quantum Boltzmann machine learning."
2510.02198,"Chaotic many-body quantum dynamics, spectral correlations, and energy   diffusion",2025-10-02T16:45:51Z,"We study chaotic many-body quantum dynamics in a minimal model with spatial structure and local interactions. It has a time-independent Hamiltonian, in contrast to much-studied quantum circuits, and is analytically tractable for large local Hilbert space dimension and weak intersite coupling. In this limit we show that energy dynamics is described by a classical master equation and is diffusive. We also show that the spectral form factor can be expressed exactly in terms of the solution to this master equation. For a two-site system we obtain closed-form expressions for both the two-point correlator of energy density and the spectral form factor, in essentially perfect agreement with numerical simulations. For an $L$-site system we show at late times how a linear ramp emerges in the spectral form factor, as universally expected from level repulsion in chaotic quantum systems. Conversely, at earlier times we identify two distinct mechanisms for an increase of the spectral form factor above its ramp value. One of these is associated with energy diffusion and is effective until the Thouless time, which varies as $L^2$. The other involves contributions like those that would appear if the system were composed of many uncoupled subsystems: they generate a large enhancement of the spectral form factor, and are suppressed on a timescale varying as $(\ln L)^2$. Besides being exact for the limit considered, we believe our approach provides the natural approximation even for small local Hilbert space dimension and strong intersite coupling. We present a numerical study of a spin-half chain, finding an early-time enhancement of the spectral form factor which is qualitatively similar to that in our solvable model."
2510.02151,A quantum analogue of convex optimization,2025-10-02T16:03:14Z,"Convex optimization is the powerhouse behind the theory and practice of optimization. We introduce a quantum analogue of unconstrained convex optimization: computing the minimum eigenvalue of a Schr\""odinger operator $h = -\Delta + V $ with convex potential $V:\mathbb R^n \rightarrow \mathbb R_{\ge 0}$ such that $V(x)\rightarrow\infty $ as $\|x\|\rightarrow\infty$. For this problem, we present an efficient quantum algorithm, called the Fundamental Gap Algorithm (FGA), that computes the minimum eigenvalue of $h$ up to error $\epsilon$ in polynomial time in $n$, $1/\epsilon$, and parameters that depend on $V$. Adiabatic evolution of the ground state is used as a key subroutine, which we analyze with novel techniques that allow us to focus on the low-energy space. We apply the FGA to give the first known polynomial-time algorithm for finding the lowest frequency of an $n$-dimensional convex drum, or mathematically, the minimum eigenvalue of the Dirichlet Laplacian on an $n$-dimensional region that is defined by $m$ linear constraints in polynomial time in $n$, $m$, $1/\epsilon$ and the radius $R$ of a ball encompassing the region."
2510.02141,Quantum speed-up for solving the one-dimensional Hubbard model using   quantum annealing,2025-10-02T15:49:36Z,"The Hubbard model has occupied the minds of condensed matter physicists for most part of the last century. This model provides insight into a range of phenomena in correlated electron systems. We wish to examine the paradigm of quantum algorithms for solving such many-body problems. The focus of our current work is on the one-dimensional model which is integrable, meaning that there exist analytical results for determining its ground state. In particular, we demonstrate how to perform a gate-based quantum computer simulation of quantum annealing for the Hubbard Hamiltonian. We perform simulations for systems with up to 40 qubits to study the scaling of required annealing time for obtaining the ground state. We find that for the half-filled cases considered, there is a substantial quantum speed-up over algorithms based on the Bethe-ansatz equations."
2510.02138,Realism and the Inequivalence of the Two Quantum Pictures,2025-10-02T15:46:18Z,"The standard claim that the Schr\""odinger and Heisenberg pictures of quantum mechanics are equivalent rests on the fact that they yield identical empirical predictions. This equivalence therefore assumes the instrumentalist worldview in which theories serve only as tools for prediction. Under scientific realism, by contrast, theories aim to describe reality. Whereas the Schr\""odinger picture posits a time-evolving wave function, the Heisenberg picture posits so-called descriptors, time-evolving generators of the algebra of observables. These two structures are non-isomorphic: descriptors surject onto but do not reduce to the Schr\""odinger state. Hence, under realism, the pictures are inequivalent. I argue that this inequivalence marks an opening toward a richer, separable ontology for quantum theory. On explanatory grounds, descriptors provide genuinely local accounts of superdense coding, teleportation, branching, and Bell inequality violations -- phenomena that the Schr\""odinger framework does not explain fully locally."
2510.02122,Optimizing fermionic Hamiltonians with classical interactions,2025-10-02T15:31:55Z,"We consider the optimization problem (ground energy search) for fermionic Hamiltonians with classical interactions. This QMA-hard problem is motivated by the Coulomb electron-electron interaction being diagonal in the position basis, a fundamental fact that underpins electronic-structure Hamiltonians in quantum chemistry and condensed matter. We prove that fermionic Gaussian states achieve an approximation ratio of at least 1/3 for such Hamiltonians, independent of sparsity. This shows that classical interactions are sufficient to prevent the vanishing Gaussian approximation ratio observed in SYK-type models. We also give efficient semi-definite programming algorithms for Gaussian approximations to several families of traceless and positive-semidefinite classically interacting Hamiltonians, with the ability to enforce a fixed particle number. The technical core of our results is the concept of a Gaussian blend, a construction for Gaussian states via mixtures of covariance matrices."
2510.02071,Resource theory of asymmetric distinguishability with partial   information,2025-10-02T14:35:09Z,"Recent studies have introduced the worst-case quantum divergence as a key measure in quantum information. Here we show that such divergences can be understood from the perspective of the resource theory of asymmetric distinguishability, which utilizes the asymmetric distinguishability between a pair of quantum states as resource. In our work, we extend this framework to settings with partial information, where the goal is to distinguish between sets of quantum states rather than individual states. Within this setting, we characterize optimal rates for resource distillation and dilution using (smoothed) one-shot divergences and regularized divergences. Our framework further exhibits a reversibility property: resource interconversions can be achieved without loss at rates determined entirely by regularized divergences. These results offer a broad operational interpretation of divergences between state sets and generalize existing resource theories to encompass incomplete information scenarios."
2510.02051,Improving neural network performance for solving quantum sign structure,2025-10-02T14:24:28Z,"Neural quantum states have emerged as a widely used approach to the numerical study of the ground states of non-stoquastic Hamiltonians. However, existing approaches often rely on a priori knowledge of the sign structure or require a separately pre-trained phase network. We introduce a modified stochastic reconfiguration method that effectively uses differing imaginary time steps to evolve the amplitude and phase. Using a larger time step for phase optimization, this method enables a simultaneous and efficient training of phase and amplitude neural networks. The efficacy of our method is demonstrated on the Heisenberg J_1-J_2 model."
2510.02035,Critical Quantum Sensing: a tutorial on parameter estimation near   quantum phase transitions,2025-10-02T14:08:11Z,"Quantum phenomena offer the possibility of measuring physical quantities with precision beyond classical limits. However, current progress is constrained by scalability, environmental noise, and challenges in practical integration. This highlights the necessity for novel approaches. An emerging paradigm in this direction is \emph{critical quantum metrology} -- which harnesses the enhanced susceptibility and nonclassical correlations naturally occurring near quantum phase transitions as resources for quantum-enhanced precision. This tutorial provides a pedagogical introduction to key concepts and a detailed overview of prominent quantum sensing strategies that exploit critical phenomena in metrology. Through examples of increasing complexity, the reader is guided through various critical quantum sensing protocols applied to different critical systems. Special emphasis is placed on the optimal scaling of estimation precision with respect to fundamental resources. Finally, we discuss how critical quantum metrology extends from idealized models to realistic open-system and dissipative regimes, and outline both the challenges and opportunities for future quantum technologies."

The solution to these problems is given by the ground states of these Hamiltonians. A state-of-the-art algorithm for finding the ground state of a Hamiltonian is the so-called Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (QITE) which approximates imaginary time evolution by a unitary evolution that can be implemented in quantum hardware. In this paper, we review the original algorithm together with a comprehensive computer program, as well as, the variational version of it."
2510.01996,Fiber-integrated NV Magnetometer with Microcontroller-based Software   Lock-in Technique,2025-10-02T13:18:11Z,"Fiber-integrated nitrogen-vacancy (NV) magnetometers possess high sensitivity, integration, and flexibility, and thus have been explored extensively for industrial applications. While most studies have focused on the optimization of the quantum sensing head, less attention has been paid to the frequently employed professional, expensive, and bulky electronics, which hinder their practical applications. In this article, we fabricate a fiber-integrated NV magnetometer and develop a low-cost microcontroller-based software lock-in technique. In this technique, a microcontroller coordinates efficiently a microwave source chip and an analog-to-digital converter, and a program mimicking the lock-in mechanism realizes microwave frequency-modulated optically detected magnetic resonance of NV centers. As a result, with our setup and technique, we have realized the detection of weak magnetic field with a sensitivity of 93 nT/Hz^{1/2}, which is comparable to what obtained with bulky and professional devices. Furthermore, we demonstrated real-time magnetic field detection, achieving a standard deviation of 488 nT. Our work provides a novel and cost-effective technique for electronic miniaturization, thereby potentially accelerating the industrial application of NV magnetometers."
2510.01993,HIV-1 protease cleavage sites detection with a Quantum convolutional   neural network algorithm,2025-10-02T13:13:54Z,"In this study, we propose a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN)-based framework with the neural quantum embedding (NQE) to predict HIV-1 protease cleavage sites in amino acid sequences from viral and human proteins. To assess the effectiveness and robustness of our framework, we compared the classification performance against classical neural networks under both noiseless and noisy simulations. Among experimental conditions, the QCNN with the angle and amplitude encoding NQE conditions consistently outperformed classical counterparts in both the similar trainable parameter scale and the different number of qubits (the averaged performance of the 4-qubits and 8-qubits QCNN: 0.9146 and 0.8929 / the averaged performance of the classical neural network: 0.6125 and 0.8278). The QCNN with the NQE showed stable performance under the quantum hardware noise, confirming its applicability to biomedical data analysis with the noise intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. This study presents the first application of NQE-augmented QCNNs for HIV-1 cleavage site classification, providing new insights into scalable and noise-resilient quantum machine learning for biomedical data."

We focus on the comparison of the results for this system with the ones corresponding to Dirichlet conditions, and the same surface space-time geometry. We show that, in d=1, the effects are equal up to second order for rather arbitrary surfaces, and up to fourth order for wavelike surfaces. For d>1, we find general expressions for their difference."
2510.01983,Digital quantum simulation of many-body localization crossover in a   disordered kicked Ising model,2025-10-02T12:57:19Z,"Simulating nonequilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems is one of the most promising applications of quantum computers. However, a faithful digital quantum simulation of the Hamiltonian evolution is very challenging in the present noisy quantum devices. Instead, nonequilibrium dynamics under the Floquet evolution realized by the Trotter decomposition of the Hamiltonian evolution with a large Trotter step size is considered to be a suitable problem for simulating in the present or near-term quantum devices. In this work, we propose simulating the many-body localization crossover as such a nonequilibrium problem in the disordered Floquet many-body systems. As a demonstration, we simulate the many-body localization crossover in a disordered kicked Ising model on a heavy-hex lattice using $60$ qubits from $156$ qubits available in the IBM Heron r2 superconducting qubit device named ibm\_fez. We compute out-of-time-ordered correlators as an indicator of the many-body localization crossover. From the late-time behavior of out-of-time-ordered correlators, we locate the quantum chaotic and many-body localized regimes as a function of the disorder strength. The validity of the results is confirmed by comparing two independent error mitigation methods, that is, the operator renormalization method and zero-noise extrapolation."
2510.01953,Formal Framework for Quantum Advantage,2025-10-02T12:22:54Z,"Motivated by notions of quantum heuristics and by average-case rather than worst-case algorithmic analysis, we define quantum computational advantage in terms of individual problem instances. Inspired by the classical notions of Kolmogorov complexity and instance complexity, we define their quantum versions. This allows us to define queasy instances of computational problems, like e.g. Satisfiability and Factoring, as those whose quantum instance complexity is significantly smaller than their classical instance complexity. These instances indicate quantum advantage: they are easy to solve on a quantum computer, but classical algorithms struggle (they feel queasy). Via a reduction from Factoring, we prove the existence of queasy Satisfiability instances; specifically, these instances are maximally queasy (under reasonable complexity-theoretic assumptions). Further, we show that there is exponential algorithmic utility in the queasiness of a quantum algorithm. This formal framework serves as a beacon that guides the hunt for quantum advantage in practice, and moreover, because its focus lies on single instances, it can lead to new ways of designing quantum algorithms."
2510.01951,Maximum heralding probabilities of non-classical state generation from   two-mode Gaussian state via photon counting measurements,2025-10-02T12:21:18Z,"Highly non-classical states of light - such as the approximate Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states or cat-like states - can be generated from experimentally accessible Gaussian states via photon counting measurements on selected modes, conditioned on specific outcomes of these heralding events. A simplest yet important example of this approach involves performing photon number measurements on one mode of a two-mode entangled Gaussian state. The heralding probability of this scheme is a key figure of merit, as it determines the generation rate of the targeted non-classical state. In this work we show that the maximum heralding probability for the two-mode setting can be calculated analytically, and we investigate its dependence on the number of detected photons n. Our results show that the number of required experimental trials scales only polynomially with n. Generation of highly complex optical quantum states with high stellar rank is thus practically feasible in this setting, given access to sufficiently strong squeezing."
2510.01923,The Constant Speed Schedule for Adiabatic State Preparation: Towards   Quadratic Speedup without Prior Spectral Knowledge,2025-10-02T11:39:35Z,"The efficiency of adiabatic quantum evolution is governed by the adiabatic evolution time, \(T\), which depends on the minimum energy gap, \(\Delta\). For a generic schedule, \(T\) typically scales as \(\Delta^{-2}\), whereas the rigorous lower bound is \(\mathcal{O}(\Delta^{-1})\). This indicates the potential for a quadratic speedup through the adiabatic schedule construction. Here, we introduce the constant speed schedule, which traverses the adiabatic path of the eigenstate at a uniform rate. We first show that this approach reduces the scaling of the upper bound of the required evolution time by one order in \(1/\Delta\). We then provide a segmented constant speed schedule protocol, in which path segment lengths are computed from eigenstate overlaps along the adiabatic evolution. By relying on the overlaps on the fly, our method eliminates the need for prior spectral knowledge. We test our algorithm numerically on the adiabatic unstructured search, the N$_2$ molecule, and the [2Fe-2S] cluster. In our numerical experiments, the method achieves the optimal \(1/\Delta\) scaling in a small gap region, thereby demonstrating a quadratic speedup over the standard linear schedule."
2510.01918,Hybrid Quantum-Classical Walks for Graph Representation Learning in   Community Detection,2025-10-02T11:35:17Z,"Graph Representation Learning (GRL) has emerged as a cornerstone technique for analysing complex, networked data across diverse domains, including biological systems, social networks, and data analysis. Traditional GRL methods often struggle to capture intricate relationships within complex graphs, particularly those exhibiting non-trivial structural properties such as power-law distributions or hierarchical structures. This paper introduces a novel quantum-inspired algorithm for GRL, utilizing hybrid Quantum-Classical Walks to overcome these limitations. Our approach combines the benefits of both quantum and classical dynamics, allowing the walker to simultaneously explore both highly local and far-reaching connections within the graph. Preliminary results for a case study in network community detection shows that this hybrid dynamic enables the algorithm to adapt effectively to complex graph topologies, offering a robust and versatile solution for GRL tasks."
2510.01900,Temporal Pulse Origins in Atom Interferometric Quantum Sensors,2025-10-02T11:13:03Z,"Quantum sensors based upon atom interferometry typically rely on radio-frequency or optical pulses to coherently manipulate atomic states and make precise measurements of inertial and gravitational effects. An advantage of these sensors over their classical counterparts is often said to be that their measurement scale factor is precisely known and highly stable. However, in practice the finite pulse duration makes the sensor scale factor dependent upon the pulse shape and sensitive to variations in control field intensity, frequency, and atomic velocity. Here, we explore the concept of a temporal pulse origin in atom interferometry, where the inertial phase response of any pulse can be parameterized using a single point in time. We show that the temporal origin permits a simple determination of the measurement scale factor and its stability against environmental perturbations. Moreover, the temporal origin can be treated as a tunable parameter in the design of tailored sequences of shaped pulses to enhance scale factor stability and minimize systematic errors. We demonstrate through simulations that this approach to pulse design can reduce overall sequence durations while increasing robustness to realistic fluctuations in control field amplitude. Our results show that the temporal pulse origin explains a broad class of systematic errors in existing devices and enables the design of short, robust pulses which we expect will improve the performance of current and next-generation interferometric quantum sensors."
2510.01890,Folding lattice proteins confined on minimal grids using a   quantum-inspired encoding,2025-10-02T10:58:31Z,"Steric clashes pose a challenge when exploring dense protein systems using conventional explicit-chain methods. A minimal example is a single lattice protein confined on a minimal grid, with no free sites. Finding its minimum energy is a hard optimization problem, withsimilarities to scheduling problems. It can be recast as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem amenable to classical and quantum approaches. We show that this problem in its QUBO form can be swiftly and consistently solved for chain length 48, using either classical simulated annealing or hybrid quantum-classical annealing on a D-Wave system. In fact, the latter computations required about 10 seconds. We also test linear and quadratic programming methods, which work well for a lattice gas but struggle with chain constraints. All methods are benchmarked against exact results obtained from exhaustive structure enumeration, at a high computational cost."
2510.01888,Counterfactual quantum measurements,2025-10-02T10:55:15Z,"Counterfactual reasoning plays a crucial role in exploring hypothetical scenarios, by comparing some consequent under conditions identical except as results from a differing antecedent. David Lewis' well-known analysis evaluates counterfactuals using a hierarchy of desiderata. These were, however, built upon a deterministic classical framework, and whether it could be generalized to indeterministic quantum theory has been an open question. In this Letter, we propose a formalism for quantum counterfactuals in which antecedents are measurement settings. Unlike other approaches, it non-trivially answers questions like: ""Given that my photon-detector, observing an atom's fluorescence, clicked at a certain time, what would I have seen using a field-quadrature detector instead?"""

This g is then applied in a non-Newtonian hidden-variable setting, producing a hybrid framework whose agreement with quantum correlations is built in by design, not derived from new physics, and thus does not constitute a genuine counterexample to Bell's theorem"
2510.01837,Purcell-enhanced single-photon generation from CsPbBr$_3$ quantum dots   in in-situ selected Laguerre-Gaussian modes,2025-10-02T09:33:24Z,"Single photons in Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) beams, which carry orbital angular momentum (OAM), could enable more robust and efficient photonic quantum communication and information processing, as well as enhanced sensitivity in quantum metrology and imaging. However, as most implementations are indirect or require additional mode-shaping elements, direct generation of single photons with OAM has received growing interest. Colloidal lead halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have recently emerged as a versatile material that can produce indistinguishable single photons quasi-deterministically at high rate. Here, we integrate single CsPbBr$_3$ QDs into an open Fabry-Perot microcavity with a nanofabricated Gaussian-shaped deformation, demonstrating Purcell-enhanced single-photon generation into individual cavity modes with up to 18.1 $\pm$ 0.2 times accelerated decay, down to tens of picoseconds. By in-situ tuning of the cavity resonance, we can selectively couple a single QD to different LG modes carrying OAM and observe the spatial patterns of the generated single-photon beams emitted from the cavity. Our findings open the door to high photon rate sources that directly generate single-photon LG beams for advanced quantum photonic applications."
2510.01836,Hybrid biphoton spectrometer for time-resolved quantum spectroscopy   across visible and near-infrared regions,2025-10-02T09:32:34Z,"Joint spectral measurements are a powerful tool for characterising biphoton spectral correlation, which is crucial for quantum information and communication technologies. In these applications, highly pure biphoton states are essential in any time- and frequency-mode, often obviating the need for time-resolved measurements. Conversely, spectroscopy utilising entangled photon pairs is gaining significant attention for its ability to unveil molecular dynamics, a field that critically demands time-resolved capabilities. Here, we introduce a novel methodology for capturing a biphoton spectrum that comprises visible and near-infrared photons, resulting in a three-fold non-degenerate joint spectrum. Our system employs two non-scanning spectrographs: a fibre spectrograph for near-infrared photons and a delay-line-anode single-photon imager for visible photons. We successfully measure the joint spectral intensity by leveraging a time-tagging acquisition strategy. Furthermore, our approach uniquely enables time-resolved joint spectral measurements with a temporal resolution of approximately 150 ps. This methodology bridges the gap between the requirements for pure biphoton states and the need for dynamic insights in quantum spectroscopy."

The experimental configuration consists of a moderately-focused pump laser beam undergoing a parametric interaction with an organic solvent (toluene) and an off-resonant laser beam probes the non-trivial spatial magnetization textures created by the pump beam. The phase-profile of the transmitted probe beam is extracted using phase-retrieval algorithms for ascertaining the topological charge which is shown to be consistent with the estimation of Berry's curvature that we obtain via paraxial approximation-based modeling of third-order nonlinear interaction.
2510.01819,"Three-Dimensional Niobium Coaxial Cavity with $\sim0.1\,$second Lifetime",2025-10-02T09:05:52Z,"We report on the internal quality factor of a three-dimensional niobium quarter-wave coaxial cavity, with mid-temperature annealing, exhibiting $Q_{\rm int} \gtrsim 3\times10^9$ at the single-photon level below 20\,mK, which corresponds to an internal photon lifetime of $\tau_{\rm int}\sim90\,\mathrm{ms}$. Moreover, $Q_{\rm int}$ of the mid-temperature annealed cavities remains almost unchanged even after several cooldown cycles and air exposure. These results suggest that stable low-loss niobium oxides might be formed by mid-temperature annealing on the surface of three-dimensional niobium cavity. This surface treatment could be applicable to the fabrication of 2D superconducting circuits and help improve the lifetime of Nb-based superconducting qubits."

We trace the evolution of the sensors' state in the presence of both dark matter effect and sensors' decoherence effects, optimizing the protocol execution time, and show that the suppression of background by a factor equal to the number of sensors is possible. This method does not require the entanglement of sensors during the signal accumulation time, hence circumventing the difficulty of maintaining the lifetime of the entangled state that is present in other enhancement proposals. This protocol is also general regarding the type of qubit sensors."

With a focus on neutral atom quantum processing units, we describe and exemplify a novel quantum reservoir computing (QRC) workflow. We conclude exploratively discussing the main challenges ahead, whilst arguing how QRC can offer a natural candidate to push forward reservoir computing applications."
2510.01786,Tunable Wigner Molecules in a Germanium Quantum Dot,2025-10-02T08:25:41Z,"The interplay between Coulomb interactions and kinetic energy underlies many exotic phases in condensed matter physics. In a two-dimensional electronic system, If Coulomb interaction dominates over kinetic energy, electrons condense into a crystalline phase which is referred as Wigner crystal. This ordered state manifests as Wigner molecule for few electrons at the microscopic scale. Observation of Wigner molecules has been reported in quantum dot and moire superlattice systems. Here we demonstrate hole Wigner molecules can be formed in a gate-defined germanium quantum dot with high tunability. By varying voltages applied to the quantum dot device, we can precisely tune the hole density by either changing the hole occupancy or the quantum dot size. For densities smaller than a certain critical value, Coulomb interaction localizes individual holes into ordered lattice sites, forming a Wigner molecule. By increasing the densities, melting process from a Wigner molecule to Fermi liquid-like particles is observed. An intermediate configuration which indicates the coexistence of ordered structure and disordered structure can be formed within a narrow effective density range. Our results provide a new platform for further exploration of the microscopic feature of strong correlated physics and open an avenue to exploit the application of Wigner molecules for quantum information in a very promising spin qubit platform."
2510.01775,Self-Sustained Oscillations of a Nonlinear Optomechanical System in the   Low-Excitation Regime,2025-10-02T08:05:42Z,"Manifesting across all time, mass and length scales, nonlinearities lie at the core of numerous physical phenomena. Next-generation quantum applications, such as quantum sensing, require the combination of nonlinearity with non-classical correlations. This necessitates the search for an experimental platform which enables a nonlinear response at ultra-low excitation levels in a system with practical sensing potential and quantum compatibility. Here, we report the observation and theoretical modeling of nonlinear dynamics in a mechanical system driven at the single-excitation level. We achieve this using a cavity-optomechanical platform with large single-photon coupling rates and a nonlinear microwave resonator. Specifically, the large Kerr nonlinearity of our superconducting microwave circuit reduces the threshold for the observation of nonlinear dynamics by four orders of magnitude, making this regime experimentally accessible at the few-photon level. The parameter-based quantitative predicative power of the theoretical description underlines our deep understanding of the physics involved and that this device concept paves the way for experiments with non-classical microwave drive schemes."

The Schroedinger equation is required discrete and endowed with PT-symmetric Robin (i.e., two-parametric) boundary conditions. Some of the rather enigmatic aspects of impact of the variability of the parameters on the emergence of the Kato's exceptional-point (EP) singularities is clarified. In particular, the current puzzle of the apparent absence of the EP degeneracies at the odd-matrix dimensions in certain simplified one-parametric cases is explained. A not quite expected existence of a multi-band spectral structure in another simplified one-parametric family of models is also revealed."

To accommodate the diverse characteristics of quantum chemical systems, numerous variants of QPE have been developed, each with distinct qubit and gate cost implications. In this paper, we quantify the impact of three key parameters on the overall quantum resource costs for the QPE algorithm: the choice between trotterization and qubitization, the use of molecular orbitals versus plane-wave basis-sets, and the selection of the fermion-to-qubit encoding scheme. From this, we establish clear performance trade-offs and delineate specific parameter regimes that minimize resource costs for relevant molecular systems. When performing phase estimation on large molecules in the fault-tolerant setting, we found the first-quantized qubitization circuit using the plane-wave basis to be the most efficient, with a gate cost scaling of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}([N^{4/3}M^{2/3}+N^{8/3}M^{1/3}]/\varepsilon)$ for a system of $N$ electrons and $M$ orbitals, which is the best known scaling to date. On the other hand, when only noisy intermediate-scale or near-term fault-tolerant systems are available, the phase estimation of small molecules can be performed with gate cost of $\mathcal{O}(M^{7}/\varepsilon^{2})$ via trotterization in the MO basis. Furthermore, we provide numerical estimations of qubit and T gate costs required to perform QPE for several real-world molecular systems under these different parameter choices."
2510.01657,Exponential Quantum Advantage for Message Complexity in Distributed   Algorithms,2025-10-02T04:28:54Z,"We investigate how much quantum distributed algorithms can outperform classical distributed algorithms with respect to the message complexity (the overall amount of communication used by the algorithm). Recently, Dufoulon, Magniez and Pandurangan (PODC 2025) have shown a polynomial quantum advantage for several tasks such as leader election and agreement. In this paper, we show an exponential quantum advantage for a fundamental task: routing information between two specified nodes of a network. We prove that for the family of ``welded trees"" introduced in the seminal work by Childs, Cleve, Deotto, Farhi, Gutmann and Spielman (STOC 2003), there exists a quantum distributed algorithm that transfers messages from the entrance of the graph to the exit with message complexity exponentially smaller than any classical algorithm. Our quantum algorithm is based on the recent ""succinct"" implementation of quantum walks over the welded trees by Li, Li and Luo (SODA 2024). Our classical lower bound is obtained by ``lifting'' the lower bound from Childs, Cleve, Deotto, Farhi, Gutmann and Spielman (STOC 2003) from query complexity to message complexity."
2510.01633,Entanglement distribution via satellite: an evaluation of competing   protocols assuming realistic free-space optical channels,2025-10-02T03:25:22Z,"A key technical requirement of any future quantum network is the ability to distribute quantum-entangled resources between two spatially separated points at a high rate and high fidelity. Entanglement distribution protocols based on satellite platforms, which transmit and receive quantum resources directly via free-space optical propagation, are therefore excellent candidates for quantum networking, since the geometry and loss characteristics of satellite networks feasibly allow for up to continental-scale ($\sim10^3$ km) over-the-horizon communication without the infrastructure, cost, or losses associated with equivalent fibre-optic networks. In this work, we explore two network topologies commonly associated with quantum networks - entanglement distribution between two satellites in low-Earth orbit mediated by a third satellite and entanglement distribution between two ground stations mediated by a satellite in low-Earth orbit, and two entanglement distribution schemes - one where the central satellite is used as a relay, and the other where the central satellite is used to generate and distribute the entangled resource directly. We compute a bound on the rate of distribution of distillable entanglement achieved by each protocol in each network topology as a function of the network channels for both single-rail discrete- (DV) and continuous-variable (CV) resources and use or non-use of probabilistic noiseless linear quantum amplification (NLA). In the case of atmospheric channels we take into account the turbulent and optical properties of the free-space propagation. We determine that for the triple-satellite network configuration, the optimal strategy is to perform a distributed NLA scheme in either CV or DV, and for the ground-satellite-ground network the optimal strategy is to distribute a DV resource via the central satellite."
2510.01628,Intrinsic Heisenberg-type lower bounds on spacelike hypersurfaces in   general relativity,2025-10-02T03:19:11Z,"We prove a coordinate- and foliation-independent Heisenberg-type lower bound for quantum states strictly localized in geodesic balls of radius $r$ on spacelike hypersurfaces of arbitrary spacetimes (with matter and a cosmological constant). The estimate depends only on the induced Riemannian geometry of the slice; it is independent of the lapse, shift, and extrinsic curvature, and controls the canonical momentum variance/uncertainty $\sigma_p$ by the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of the Laplace-Beltrami operator (Theorem). On weakly mean-convex balls we obtain the universal product inequality $\sigma_p\,r \ge \hbar/2$, whose constant is optimal and never attained (Corollary). This result abstracts and extends the framework recently introduced for black-hole slices in [10]."
2510.01626,Classification of Thouless pumps with non-invertible symmetries and   implications for Floquet phases,2025-10-02T03:06:10Z,"We study symmetry preserving adiabatic and Floquet dynamics of one-dimensional systems. Using quasiadiabatic evolution, we establish a correspondence between adiabatic cycles and invertible defects generated by spatially truncated Thouless pump operators. Employing the classification of gapped phases by module categories, we show that the Thouless pumps are classified by the group of autoequivalences of the module category. We then explicitly construct Thouless pump operators for minimal lattice models with $\text{Vec}_G$, Rep($G$), and Rep($H$) symmetries, and show how the Thouless pump operators have the group structure of autoequivalences. The Thouless pump operators, together with Hamiltonians with gapped ground states, are then used to construct Floquet drives. An analytic solution for the Floquet phase diagram characterized by winding numbers is constructed when the Floquet drives obey an Onsager algebra. Our approach points the way to a general connection between distinct Thouless pumps and distinct families of Floquet phases."
2510.01610,Higher moment theory and learnability of bosonic states,2025-10-02T02:48:04Z,"We present a sample- and time-efficient algorithm to learn any bosonic Fock state acted upon by an arbitrary Gaussian unitary. As a special case, this algorithm efficiently learns states produced in Fock state BosonSampling, thus resolving an open question put forth by Aaronson and Grewal (Aaronson, Grewal 2023). We further study a hierarchy of classes of states beyond Gaussian states that are specified by a finite number of their higher moments. Using the higher moments, we find a full spectrum of invariants under Gaussian unitaries, thereby providing necessary conditions for two states to be related by an arbitrary (including active, e.g. beyond linear optics) Gaussian unitary."
2510.01596,Limitations of strong coupling in non-Markovian quantum thermometry,2025-10-02T02:20:44Z,"We investigate quantum thermometry using a single-qubit probe embedded in a non-Markovian environment, employing the numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) to overcome the limitations of Born-Markov approximations. Through a systematic analysis of the dynamical and steady-state behavior of the quantum signal-to-noise ratio (QSNR) for temperature estimation, we identify several key findings that challenge the conventional expectation that strong coupling necessarily enhances thermometric performance. In non-equilibrium dynamical thermometry, weak system-environment coupling generally yields the optimal QSNR, whereas in the steady-state regime, strong coupling enhances sensitivity only in the ultra-low-temperature limit, while weak coupling significantly improves precision at moderately low temperatures. To optimize performance across coupling regimes, we develop a hybrid computational framework that integrates HEOM with quantum-enhanced particle swarm optimization, enabling precise quantum dynamical control under varying coupling strengths. Our results reveal fundamental constraints and opportunities in quantum thermometry, offering practical strategies for the design of high-performance quantum thermometers operating in realistic open quantum systems."
2510.01584,Directionality and quantum backfire in continuous-time quantum walks   from delocalized states: Exact results,2025-10-02T02:05:07Z,"We derive analytical results for continuous-time quantum walks from a new class of initial states with tunable delocalization. The dynamics are governed by a Hamiltonian with complex hopping amplitudes. We provide closed-form equations for key observables, revealing three notable findings: (1) the emergence of directed quantum transport from completely unbiased initial conditions; (2) a quantum backfire effect, where greater initial delocalization enhances short-time spreading but counterintuitively induces a comparatively smaller long-time spreading after a crossing time $t_{\mathrm{cross}}$; and (3) an exact characterization of survival probability, showing that the transition to an enhanced $t^{-3}$ decay is a fine-tuned effect. Our work establishes a comprehensive framework for controlling quantum transport through the interplay between intermediate initial delocalization and Hamiltonian phase."
2510.01563,"Quantum advantages in ground state preparation, combinatorial   optimization, and quantum state preparation",2025-10-02T01:17:22Z,"We show that for any quantum Hamiltonian with an inverse-polynomial gap, the ground state can be prepared in a polynomial circuit depth to inverse-polynomial precision, if the system size is sufficiently large. The resulting circuit is composed of a polynomial number of Pauli rotations without ancilla qubit. Extending this result, we prove that for sufficiently large qubit number, any quantum state can be approximately prepared with a constant (polynomial) number of Pauli rotations to constant (inverse-polynomial) precision. Our theoretical findings reveal exponential quantum advantages in the prominent applications: ground state preparation, combinatorial optimization, and quantum state preparation."
2510.01557,Design and Characterization of a Cryogenic Vacuum Chamber for Ion   Trapping Experiments,2025-10-02T01:01:43Z,"We present the design and characterization of a cryogenic vacuum chamber incorporating mechanical isolation from vibrations, a high numerical-aperture in-vacuum imaging objective, in-vacuum magnetic shielding, and an antenna for global radio-frequency manipulation of trapped ions. The cold shield near 4 K is mechanically referenced to an underlying optical table via thermally insulating supports and exhibits root-mean-square vibrations less than 7.61(4) nm. Using the in-vacuum objective, we can detect 397 nm photons from a trapped $^{40}\mathrm{Ca}^{+}$ ion with 1.77% efficiency and achieve 99.9963(4)% single-shot state-detection fidelity in 50 $\mu$s. To characterize the efficacy of the magnetic shields, we perform Ramsey experiments on the ground state qubit and obtain a coherence time of 24(2) ms, which extends to 0.25(1) s with a single spin-echo pulse. XY4 and XY32 dynamical decoupling sequences driven via the radio-frequency antenna extend the coherence to 0.72(2) s and 0.81(3) s, respectively."
2510.01543,Variational approach to open quantum systems with long-range competing   interactions,2025-10-02T00:29:00Z,"Competition between short- and long-range interactions underpins many emergent phenomena in nature. Despite rapid progress in their experimental control, computational methods capable of accurately simulating open quantum many-body systems with complex long-ranged interactions at scale remain scarce. Here, we address this limitation by introducing an efficient and scalable approach to dissipative quantum lattices in one and two dimensions, combining matrix product operators and time-dependent variational Monte Carlo. We showcase the versatility, effectiveness, and unique methodological advantages of our algorithm by simulating the non-equilibrium dynamics and steady states of spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ lattices with competing algebraically-decaying interactions for as many as $N=200$ sites, revealing the emergence of spatially-modulated magnetic order far from equilibrium. This approach offers promising prospects for advancing our understanding of the complex non-equilibrium properties of a diverse variety of experimentally-realizable quantum systems with long-ranged interactions, including Rydberg atoms, ultracold dipolar molecules, and trapped ions."
2510.01504,Robust Rydberg facilitation via rapid adiabatic passage,2025-10-01T22:48:29Z,"We propose and analyze a robust implementation of Rydberg antiblockade based on rapid adiabatic passage. Although Rydberg antiblockade offers key opportunities in quantum information processing and sensing, its sensitivity to position disorder and parameter imperfections has posed a central roadblock. By adiabatically sweeping across the interaction-shifted resonance, our approach is unaffected by realistic levels of disorder and parameter variations. As a straightforward application case, we show that it naturally gives rise to avalanche excitation growth in both one- and two-dimensional arrays. This avalanche process yields high gain with exceptionally low background, making it promising for rare-event detection. These results establish a practical route to robust Rydberg antiblockade dynamics, paving the way for future experimental and technological applications."
2510.01497,Anisotropic and non-additive interactions of a Rydberg impurity in a   quantum bath,2025-10-01T22:15:45Z,"We present a framework for treating anisotropic and non-additive impurity-bath interactions - features that are ubiquitous in realistic quantum impurity problems, but are often neglected in conventional approaches relying on additive, spherically symmetric pseudopotentials. To illustrate this, we focus on a Rydberg atom immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate, where the internal-state degeneracy of the Rydberg impurity gives rise to configuration-dependent non-additive potentials. With increasing interaction strength, anisotropy-induced partial-wave mixing generates distinct polaron and molaron resonances, allowing for radially and angularly excited bound states to become accessible. This approach captures the anisotropy and non-additivity characteristic of a Rydberg impurity immersed in a quantum bath, and provides broad applicability to a host of quantum impurity problems beyond the Fr\""ohlich paradigm."
2510.02402,"Probability distributions over CSS codes: two-universality, QKD hashing,   collision bounds, security",2025-10-01T21:52:00Z,"We characterize novel probability distributions for CSS codes. Such classes of error correcting codes, originally introduced by Calderbank, Shor, and Steane, are of great significance in advancing the fidelity of Quantum computation, with implications for future near term applications. Within the context of Quantum key distribution, such codes, as examined by Ostrev in arXiv: 2109.06709 along with two-universal hashing protocols, have greatly simplified Quantum phases of computation for unconditional security. To further examine novel applications of two-universal hashing protocols, particularly through the structure of parity check matrices, we demonstrate how being able to efficiently compute functions of the parity check matrices relates to marginals of a suitably defined probability measure supported over random matrices. The security of the two-universal QKD hashing protocol will be shown to depend upon the computation of purified states of random matrices, which relates to probabilistic collision bounds between two hashing functions. Central to our approach are the introduction of novel real, simulator, and ideal, isometries, hence allowing for efficient computations of functions of the two parity check matrices. As a result of being able to perform such computations involving parity check matrices, the security of the two-universal hashing protocol is a factor of $2^{ \frac{5}{2} ( 5 - \frac{3}{2} ) + \mathrm{log}_2 \sqrt{C}}$ less secure, for some strictly positive constant $C$."
2510.01477,Emission of pairs of Minkowski photons through the lens of the Unruh   effect,2025-10-01T21:40:26Z,"We discuss the emission of pairs of photons by charges with generic worldlines in the Minkowski vacuum from the viewpoint of inertial observers and interpret them from the perspective of Rindler observers. We show that the emission of pairs of Minkowski photons corresponds, in general, to three distinct processes according to Rindler observers: scattering, and emission and absorption of pairs of Rindler photons. In the special case of uniformly accelerated charges, the radiation observed in the inertial frame can be fully described by the scattering channel in the Rindler frame. Therefore, the emission of pairs of Minkowski photons -- commonly referred to as Unruh radiation -- can be seen as further evidence supporting the Unruh effect."
2510.01464,Isogeny Graphs in Superposition and Quantum Onion Routing,2025-10-01T21:15:22Z,"Onion routing provides anonymity by layering encryption so that no relay can link sender to destination. A quantum analogue faces a core obstacle: layered quantum encryption generally requires symmetric encryption schemes, whereas classically one would rely on public-key encryption. We propose a symmetric-encryption-based quantum onion routing (QOR) scheme by instantiating each layer with the abelian ideal class group action from the Theory of Complex Multiplication. Session keys are established locally via a Diffie-Hellman key exchange between neighbors in the chain of communication. Furthermore, we propose a novel ''non-local'' key exchange between the sender and receiver. The underlying problem remains hard even for quantum adversaries and underpins the security of current post-quantum schemes. We connect our construction to isogeny graphs and their association schemes, using the Bose-Mesner algebra to formalize commutativity and guide implementation. We give two implementation paths: (i) a universal quantum oracle evaluating the class group action with polynomially many quantum resources, and (ii) an intrinsically quantum approach via continuous-time quantum walks (CTQWs), outlined here and developed in a companion paper. A small Qiskit example illustrates the mechanics (by design, not the efficiency) of the QOR."
2510.01455,"Visualizing the state space of quantum trits, quadits, and pairs of   qubits via toric geometry",2025-10-01T20:50:50Z,We propose some new uses of toric variety structures in the study of quantum computation for various radices.
2510.01435,Coupling Magnons to an Opto-Electronic Parametric Oscillator,2025-10-01T20:18:49Z,"Hybrid magnonic systems have emerged as versatile modular components for quantum signal transduction and sensing applications owing to their capability of connecting distinct quantum platforms. To date, the majority of the magnonic systems have been explored in a local, near-field scheme, due to the close proximity required for realizing a strong coupling between magnons and other excitations. This constraint greatly limits the applicability of magnons in developing remotely-coupled, distributed quantum network systems. On the contrary, opto-electronic architectures hosting self-sustained oscillations has been a unique platform for longhaul signal transmission and processing. Here, we integrated an opto-electronic oscillator with a magnonic oscillator consisting of a microwave waveguide and a Y3Fe5O12(YIG) sphere, and demonstrated strong and coherent coupling between YIG's magnon modes and the opto-electronic oscillator's characteristic photon modes - revealing the hallmark anti-crossing gap in the measured spectrum. In particular, the photon mode is produced on-demand via a nonlinear, parametric process as stipulated by an external seed pump. Both the internal cavity phase and the external pump phase can be precisely tuned to stabilize either degenerate or nondegenerate auto-oscillations. Our result lays out a new, hybrid platform for investigating long-distance coupling and nonlinearity in coherent magnonic phenomena, which may be find useful in constructing future distributed hybrid magnonic systems."
2510.01424,Optimal Quantum Information Transmission Under a Continuous-Variable   Erasure Channel,2025-10-01T20:02:14Z,"Quantum capacity gives the fundamental limit of information transmission through a channel. However, evaluating the quantum capacities of a continuous-variable bosonic quantum channel, as well as finding an optimal code to achieve the optimal information transmission rate, is in general challenging. In this work, we derive the quantum capacity and entanglement-assisted quantum capacity of the bosonic continuous-variable erasure channel when subject to energy constraints. We then construct random codes based on scrambling information within the typical subspace of the encoding state and prove that these codes are asymptotically optimal up to a constant gap. Finally, using our random coding scheme we design a bosonic variation of the Hayden-Preskill protocol and find that information recovery depends on the ratio between the input and output modes. This is in contrast with the conventional discrete-variable scenario which requires only a fixed number of additional output qudits."
2510.01416,Quantum Signatures of Strange Attractors,2025-10-01T19:52:16Z,"In classical mechanics, driven systems with dissipation often exhibit complex, fractal dynamics known as strange attractors. This paper addresses the fundamental question of how such structures manifest in the quantum realm. We investigate the quantum Duffing oscillator, a paradigmatic chaotic system, using the Caldirola-Kanai (CK) framework, where dissipation is integrated directly into a time-dependent Hamiltonian. By employing the Husimi distribution to represent the quantum state in phase space, we present the first visualization of a quantum strange attractor within this model. Our simulations demonstrate how an initially simple Gaussian wave packet is stretched, folded, and sculpted by the interplay of chaotic dynamics and energy loss, causing it to localize onto a structure that beautifully mirrors the classical attractor. This quantum ""photograph"" is inherently smoothed, blurring the infinitely fine fractal details of its classical counterpart as a direct consequence of the uncertainty principle. We supplement this analysis by examining the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC), which shows that stronger dissipation clarifies the exponential growth associated with the classical Lyapunov exponent, thereby confirming the model's semiclassical behavior. This work offers a compelling geometric perspective on open chaotic quantum systems and sheds new light on the quantum-classical transition."
2510.01380,Non-stabilizerness in quantum-enhanced metrological protocols,2025-10-01T19:08:39Z,"Non-stabilizerness (colloquially ""magic"") characterizes genuinely quantum (beyond-Clifford) operations necessary for preparation of quantum states, and can be measured by stabilizer R\'enyi entropy (SRE). For permutationally symmetric states, we show that the SRE depends, for sufficiently large systems, only on a constant number of expectation values of collective spin operators. This compact description is leveraged for analysis of spin-squeezing protocols, which inherently generate non-stabilizerness. Under one-axis twisting (OAT), the generation of optimal squeezing is accompanied by a logarithmic divergence of SRE with system system size. Continued time evolution under OAT produces metrologically useful ""kitten"" states-superpositions of rotated GHZ states-that feature many-body Bell correlations but exhibit a smaller, system-size-independent SRE that decreases with increasing Bell-correlation strength. Our results reveal connections between non-stabilizerness, multipartite correlations, and quantum metrology, and provide a practical route to quantify non-stabilizerness in experiments for precision sensing."
